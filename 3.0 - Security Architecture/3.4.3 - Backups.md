####  Backups  

• Incredibly important  
– Recover important and valuable data  
– Plan for disaster  
• Many different implementations  
– Total amount of data  
– Type of backup  
– Backup media  
– Storage location  
– Backup and recovery software  
– Day of the week  
<br>


####  Onsite vs. offsite backups  

• On site backups  
– No Internet link required  
– Data is immediately available  
– Generally less expensive than off site  
• Off site backups  
– Transfer data over Internet or WAN link  
– Data is available after a disaster  
– Restoration can be performed from anywhere  
• Organizations often use both  
– More copies of the data  
– More options when restoring  
<br>


####  Frequency  

• How often to backup  
– Every week, day, hour?  
• This may be different between systems  
– Some systems may not change much each day  
• May have multiple backup sets  
– Daily, weekly, and monthly  
• This requires significant planning  
– Multiple backup sets across different days  
– Lots of media to manage  
<br>


####  Encryption  

• A history of data is on backup media  
– Some of this media may be offsite  
• This makes it very easy for an attacker  
– All of the data is in one place  
• Protect backup data using encryption  
– Everything on the backup media is unreadable  
– The recovery key is required to restore the data  
• Especially useful for cloud backups and storage  
– Prevent anyone from eavesdropping  
<br>


####  Snapshots  

• Became popular on virtual machines  
– Very useful in cloud environments  
• Take a snapshot  
– An instant backup of an entire system  
– Save the current configuration and data  
• Take another snapshot after 24 hours  
– Contains only the changes between snapshots  
• Take a snapshot every day  
– Revert to any snapshot  
– Very fast recovery

<br>


####  Recovery testing  

• It’s not enough to perform the backup  
– You have to be able to restore  
• Disaster recovery testing  
– Simulate a disaster situation  
– Restore from backup  
• Confirm the restoration  
– Test the restored application and data  
• Perform periodic audits  
– Always have a good backup  
– Weekly, monthly, quarterly checks  
<br>


####  Replication  

• An ongoing, almost real-time backup  
– Keep data synchronized in multiple locations  
• Data is available  
– There’s always a copy somewhere  
• Data can be stored locally to all users  
– Replicate data to all remote sites  
• Data is recoverable  
– Disasters can happen at any time  
<br>


####  Journaling  

• Power goes out while writing data to storage  
– The stored data is probably corrupted  
• Recovery could be complicated  
– Remove corrupted files, restore from backup  
• Before writing to storage, make a journal entry  
– After the journal is written, write the data to storage  
• After the data is written to storage, update the journal  
– Clear the entry and get ready for the next
