####  Device placement  

• Every network is different  
– There are often similarities  
• Firewalls  
– Separate trusted from untrusted  
– Provide additional security checks  
• Other services may require their own security technologies  
– Honeypots, jump server, load balancers, sensors  
<br>


####  Security zones  

• Zone-based security technologies  
– More flexible (and secure) than IP address ranges  
• Each area of the network is associated with a zone  
– Trusted, untrusted  
– Internal, external  
– Inside, Internet, Servers, Databases, Screened  
• This simplifies security policies  
– Trusted to Untrusted  
– Untrusted to Screened  
– Untrusted to Trusted

####  Attack surface  

• How many ways into your home?  
– Doors, windows, basements  
• Everything can be a vulnerability  
– Application code  
– Open ports  
• Authentication process  
– Human error  
• Minimize the surface  
– Audit the code  
– Block ports on the firewall  
– Monitor network traffic in real-time  
<br>


####  Connectivity  

• Everything contributes to security  
– Including the network connection  
• Secure network cabling  
– Protect the physical drops  
• Application-level encryption  
– The hard work has already been done  
• Network-level encryption  
– IPsec tunnels, VPN connections
