####  Cloud responsibility matrix  

• IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, etc.  
– Who is responsible for security?  
• Security should be well documented  
– Most cloud providers provide a matrix of responsibilities  
– Everyone knows up front  
• These responsibilities can vary  
– Different cloud providers  
– Contractual agreements  
– Responsibility matrix example

<br>


####  Hybrid considerations  

• Hybrid cloud  
– More than one public or private cloud  
– This adds additional complexity  
• Network protection mismatches  
– Authentication across platforms  
– Firewall configurations  
– Server settings  
• Different security monitoring  
– Logs are diverse and cloud-specific  
• Data leakage  
– Data is shared across the public Internet  
<br>


####  Third-party vendors in the cloud  

• You, the cloud provider, and third parties  
– Infrastructure technologies  
– Cloud-based appliances  
• Ongoing vendor risk assessments  
– Part of an overall vendor risk management policy  
• Include third-party impact for incident response  
– Everyone is part of the process  
• Constant monitoring  
– Watch for changes and unusual activity  
<br>


####  Infrastructure as code  

• Describe an infrastructure  
– Define servers, network, and applications as code  
• Modify the infrastructure and create versions  
– The same way you version application code  
• Use the description (code) to build other application instances  
– Build it the same way every time based on the code  
• An important concept for cloud computing  
– Build a perfect version every time  
<br>


####  Serverless architecture  

• Function as a Service (FaaS)  
– Apps are separated into individual, autonomous functions  
– Remove the operating system from the equation  
• Developer still creates the server-side logic  
– Runs in a stateless compute container  
• May be event triggered and ephemeral  
– May only run for one event  
• Managed by a third-party  
– All OS security concerns are at the third-party  
<br>


####  Microservices and APIs  

• Monolithic applications  
– One big application that does everything  
• Application contains all decision making processes  
– User interface, business logic, data input and output  
• Code challenges  
– Large codebase, change control challenges  
• APIs - Application Programming Interfaces  
• API is the “glue” for the microservices  
– Work together to act as the application  
• Scalable - Scale just the microservices you need  
• Resilient - Outages are contained  
• Security and compliance - Containment is built-in
