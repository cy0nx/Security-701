####  Port security  

• We’ve created many authentication methods through the years  
– A network administrator has many choices  
• Use a username and password  
– Other factors can be included  
• Commonly used on wireless networks  
– Also works on wired networks  
<br>


####  EAP  

• Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)  
– An authentication framework  
• Many different ways to authenticate based on RFC standards  
– Manufacturers can build their own EAP methods  
• EAP integrates with 802.1X  
– Prevents access to the network until the authentication succeeds  
<br>


####  IEEE 802.1X  

• IEEE 802.1X  
– Port-based Network Access Control (NAC)  
– You don’t get access to the network until you authenticate  
• EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)  
– 802.1X prevents access to the network until the authentication succeeds  
• Used in conjunction with an authentication database  
– RADIUS, LDAP, TACACS+, Kerberos, etc.

####  IEEE 802.1X and EAP  

• Supplicant - the client  
• Authenticator - The device that provides access  
• Authentication server - Validates the client credentials
