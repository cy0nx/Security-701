####  Attacks can happen anywhere  

• Two categories for IT security  
– The on-premises data is more secure!  
– The cloud-based data is more secure!  
• Cloud-based security is centralized and costs less  
– No dedicated hardware, no data center to secure  
– A third-party handles everything  
• On-premises puts the security burden on the client  
– Data center security and infrastructure costs  
• Attackers want your data - They don’t care where it is  
<br>


####  On-premises security  

• Customize your security posture  
– Full control when everything is in-house  
• On-site IT team can manage security better  
– The local team can ensure everything is secure  
– A local team can be expensive and difficult to staff  
• Local team maintains uptime and availability  
– System checks can occur at any time  
– No phone call for support  
• Security changes can take time  
– New equipment, configurations, and additional costs  
<br>


####  Centralized vs. decentralized  

• Most organizations are physically decentralized  
– Many locations, cloud providers, operating systems, etc.  
• Difficult to manage and protect so many diverse systems  
– Centralize the security management  
• A centralized approach  
– Correlated alerts  
– Consolidated log file analysis  
– Comprehensive system status and maintenance/patching  
• It’s not perfect  
– Single point of failure, potential performance issues  
<br>


####  Virtualization  

• Virtualization  
– Run many different operating systems on the same hardware  
• Each application instance has its own operating system  
– Adds overhead and complexity  
– Virtualization is relatively expensive

<br>


####  Application containerization  

• Container  
– Contains everything you need to run an application  
– Code and dependencies  
– A standardized unit of software  
• An isolated process in a sandbox  
– Self-contained  
– Apps can’t interact with each other  
• Container image  
– A standard for portability  
– Lightweight, uses the host kernel  
– Secure separation between applications

<br>


####  IoT (Internet of Things)  

• Sensors  
– Heating and cooling, lighting  
• Smart devices  
– Home automation, video doorbells  
• Wearable technology  
– Watches, health monitors  
• Facility automation  
– Temperature, air quality, lighting  
• Weak defaults  
– IOT manufacturers are not security professionals  
<br>


####  SCADA / ICS  

• Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System  
– Large-scale, multi-site Industrial Control Systems (ICS)  
• PC manages equipment  
– Power generation, refining, manufacturing equipment  
– Facilities, industrial, energy, logistics  
• Distributed control systems  
– Real-time information  
– System control  
• Requires extensive segmentation  
– No access from the outside  
<br>


####  RTOS (Real-Time Operating System)  

• An operating system with a deterministic processing schedule  
– No time to wait for other processes  
– Industrial equipment, automobiles,  
– Military environments  
• Extremely sensitive to security issues  
– Non-trivial systems  
– Need to always be available  
– Difficult to know what type of security is in place  
<br>


####  Embedded systems  

• Hardware and software designed for a specific function  
– Or to operate as part of a larger system  
• Is built with only this task in mind  
– Can be optimized for size and/or cost  
• Common examples  
– Traffic light controllers  
– Digital watches  
– Medical imaging systems  
<br>


####  High availability  

• Redundancy doesn’t always mean always available  
– May need to be powered on manually  
• HA (high availability)  
– Always on, always available  
• May include many different components working together  
– Active/Active can provide scalability advantages  
• Higher availability almost always means higher costs  
– There’s always another contingency you could add  
– Upgraded power, high-quality server components, etc.
