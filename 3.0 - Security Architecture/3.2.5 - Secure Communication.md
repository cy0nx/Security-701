####  VPNs  

• Virtual Private Networks  
– Encrypted (private) data traversing a public network  
• Concentrator  
– Encryption/decryption access device  
– Often integrated into a firewall  
• Many deployment options  
– Specialized cryptographic hardware  
– Software-based options available  
• Used with client software - Sometimes built into the OS  
<br>


####  Encrypted tunnel  

• Keep data private across the public Internet  
– Encryption is the key  
• Encrypt your data - Add new headers and trailers  
• Decrypt on the other side - Original data is delivered  
<br>


####  SSL/TLS VPN (Secure Sockets Layer VPN)  

• Uses common SSL/TLS protocol (tcp/443)  
– (Almost) No firewall issues!  
• No big VPN clients  
– Usually remote access communication  
• Authenticate users  
– No requirement for digital certificates or shared passwords (like IPSec)  
• Can be run from a browser or from a (usually light) VPN client  
– Across many operating systems  
<br>


####  SSL/TLS VPN  

• On-demand access from a remote device  
– Software connects to a VPN concentrator  
• Some software can be configured as always-on

<br>


####  Site-to-site IPsec VPN  

• Always-on  
– Or almost always  
• Firewalls often act as VPN concentrators  
– Probably already have firewalls in place

<br>


####  SD-WAN  

• Software Defined Networking in a Wide Area Network  
– A WAN built for the cloud  
• The data center used to be in one place  
– The cloud has changed everything  
• Cloud-based applications communicate directly to the cloud  
– No need to hop through a central point  
<br>


####  Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)  

• Update secure access for cloud services  
– Securely connect from different locations  
• Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)  
– A “next generation” VPN  
• Security technologies are in the cloud  
– Located close to existing cloud services  
• SASE clients on all devices  
– Streamlined and automatic

<br>


####  Selection of effective controls  

• Many different security options  
– Selecting the right choice can be challenging  
• VPN  
– SSL/TLS VPN for user access  
– IPsec tunnels for site-to-site access  
• SD-WAN  
– Manage the network connectivity to the cloud  
– Does not adequately address security concerns  
• SASE  
– A complete network and security solution  
– Requires planning and implementation
