####  Recovery testing  

• Test yourselves before an actual event  
– Scheduled update sessions (annual, semi-annual, etc.)  
• Use well-defined rules of engagement  
– Do not touch the production systems  
• Very specific scenario  
– Limited time to run the event  
• Evaluate response  
– Document and discuss  
<br>


####  Tabletop exercises  

• Performing a full-scale disaster drill can be costly  
– And time consuming  
• Many of the logistics can be determined through analysis  
– You don’t physically have to go through a disaster or drill  
• Get key players together for a tabletop exercise  
– Talk through a simulated disaster  
<br>


####  Fail over  

• A failure is often inevitable  
– It’s “when,” not “if”  
• We may be able to keep running  
– Plan for the worst  
• Create a redundant infrastructure  
– Multiple routers, firewalls, switches, etc.  
• If one stops working, fail over to the operational unit  
– Many infrastructure devices and services can do this automatically  
<br>


####  Simulation  

• Test with a simulated event  
– Phishing attack, password requests, data breaches  
• Going phishing  
– Create a phishing email attack  
– Send to your actual user community  
– See who bites  
• Test internal security  
– Did the phishing get past the filter?  
• Test the users  
– Who clicked?  
– Additional training may be required  
<br>


####  Parallel processing  

• Split a process through multiple (parallel) CPUs  
– A single computer with multiple CPU cores or multiple physical CPUs  
– Multiple computers  
• Improved performance  
– Split complex transactions across multiple processors  
• Improved recovery  
– Quickly identify a faulty system  
– Take the faulty device out of the list of available processors  
– Continue operating with the remaining processors
