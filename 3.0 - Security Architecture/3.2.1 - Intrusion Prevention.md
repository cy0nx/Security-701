####  Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)  

• Intrusion Prevention System  
– Watch network traffic  
• Intrusions  
– Exploits against operating systems, applications, etc.  
– Buffer overflows, cross-site scripting, other vulnerabilities  
• Detection vs. Prevention  
– Intrusion Detection System (IDS) – Alarm or alert  
– Prevention – Stop it before it gets into the network  
<br>


####  Failure modes  

• We hope for 100% uptime  
– This obviously isn’t realistic  
– Eventually, something will break  
• Fail-open  
– When a system fails, data continues to flow  
• Fail-closed  
– When a system fails, data does not flow  
<br>


####  Device connections  

• Active monitoring  
– System is connected inline  
– Data can be blocked in real-time as it passes by  
– Intrusion prevention is commonly active

• Passive monitoring  
– A copy of the network traffic is examined using a tap or port monitor  
– Data cannot be blocked in real-time  
– Intrusion detection is commonly passive
