####  Geographic restrictions  

• Network location  
– Identify based on IP subnet  
– Can be difficult with mobile devices  
• Geolocation - determine a user’s location  
– GPS - mobile devices, very accurate  
– 802.11 wireless, less accurate  
– IP address, not very accurate  
• Geofencing  
– Automatically allow or restrict access when the user is in a particular location  
– Don’t allow this app to run unless you’re near the office  
<br>


####  Protecting data  

• A primary job task  
– An organization is out of business without data  
• Data is everywhere  
– On a storage drive, on the network, in a CPU  
• Protecting the data  
– Encryption, security policies  
• Data permissions  
– Not everyone has the same access  
<br>


####  Encryption  

• Encode information into unreadable data  
– Original information is plaintext, encrypted form is ciphertext  
• This is a two-way street  
– Convert between one and the other  
– If you have the proper key  
• Confusion  
– The encrypted data is drastically different than the plaintext  
<br>


####  Hashing  

• Represent data as a short string of text  
– A message digest, a fingerprint  
• One-way trip  
– Impossible to recover the original message from the digest  
– Used to store passwords / confidentiality  
• Verify a downloaded document is the same as the original  
– Integrity  
• Can be a digital signature  
– Authentication, non-repudiation, and integrity  
– Will not have a collision (hopefully)  
– Different messages will not have the same hash  
<br>


####  Obfuscation  

• Obfuscate  
– Make something normally understandable very difficult to understand  
• Take perfectly readable code and turn it into nonsense  
– The developer keeps the readable code and gives you the chicken scratch  
– Both sets of code perform exactly the same way  
• Helps prevent the search for security holes  
– Makes it more difficult to figure out what’s happening  
– But not impossible  
<br>


####  Masking  

• A type of obfuscation  
– Hide some of the original data  
• Protects PII  
– And other sensitive data  
• May only be hidden from view  
– The data may still be intact in storage  
– Control the view based on permissions  
• Many different techniques  
– Substituting, shuffling, encrypting, masking out, etc.  
<br>


####  Tokenization  

• Replace sensitive data with a non-sensitive placeholder  
– SSN 266-12-1112 is now 691-61-8539  
• Common with credit card processing  
– Use a temporary token during payment  
– An attacker capturing the card numbers can’t use them later  
• This isn’t encryption or hashing  
– The original data and token aren’t mathematically related  
– No encryption overhead  
<br>


####  Segmentation  

• Many organizations use a single data source  
– One large database  
• One breach puts all of the data at risk  
– You’re making it easy for the attacker  
• Separate the data  
– Store it in different locations  
• Sensitive data should have stronger security  
– The most sensitive data should be the most secure  
<br>


####  Permission restrictions  

• Control access to an account  
– It’s more than just username and password  
– Determine what policies are best for an organization  
• The authentication process  
– Password policies  
– Authentication factor policies  
– Other considerations  
• Permissions after login  
– Another line of defense  
– Prevent unauthorized access
