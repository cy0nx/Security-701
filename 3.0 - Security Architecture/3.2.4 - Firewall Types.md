####  The universal security control  

• Standard issue  
– Home, office, and in your operating system  
• Control the flow of network traffic  
– Everything passes through the firewall  
• Corporate control of outbound and inbound data  
– Sensitive materials  
• Control of inappropriate content  
– Not safe for work, parental controls  
• Protection against evil  
– Anti-virus, anti-malware  
<br>


####  Network-based firewalls  

• Filter traffic by port number or application  
– OSI layer 4 vs. OSI layer 7  
– Traditional vs. NGFW firewalls  
• Encrypt traffic  
– VPN between sites  
• Most firewalls can be layer 3 devices (routers)  
– Often sits on the ingress/egress of the network  
– Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality  
– Authenticate dynamic routing communication  
<br>


####  UTM / All-in-one security appliance  

• Unified Threat Management (UTM)  
– Web security gateway  
• URL filter / Content inspection  
– Malware inspection  
• Spam filter  
– CSU/DSU  
• Router, Switch  
– Firewall  
• IDS/IPS  
– Bandwidth shaper  
– VPN endpoint  
<br>


####  Next-generation firewall (NGFW)  

• The OSI Application Layer  
– All data in every packet  
• Can be called different names  
– Application layer gateway  
– Stateful multilayer inspection  
– Deep packet inspection  
• Requires some advanced decodes  
– Every packet must be analyzed and categorized before a security decision is determined  
<br>


####  NGFWs  

• Network-based Firewalls  
– Control traffic flows based on the application  
– Microsoft SQL Server, Twitter, YouTube  
• Intrusion Prevention Systems  
– Identify the application  
– Apply application-specific vulnerability signatures to the traffic  
• Content filtering  
– URL filters  
– Control website traffic by category  
<br>


####  Web application firewall (WAF)  

• Not like a “normal” firewall  
– Applies rules to HTTP/HTTPS conversations  
• Allow or deny based on expected input  
– Unexpected input is a common method of exploiting an application  
• SQL injection  
– Add your own commands to an application’s SQL query  
• A major focus of Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
