####  Jump server  

• Access secure network zones  
– Provides an access mechanism to a protected network  
• Highly-secured device  
– Hardened and monitored  
• SSH / Tunnel / VPN to the jump server  
– RDP, SSH, or jump from there  
• A significant security concern  
– Compromise of the jump server is a significant breach

####  Proxies  

• Sits between the users and the external network  
• Receives the user requests and sends the request on their behalf (the proxy)  
• Useful for caching information, access control, URL filtering, content scanning  
• Applications may need to know how to use the proxy (explicit)  
• Some proxies are invisible (transparent)  
<br>


####  Application proxies  

• One of the simplest “proxies” is NAT  
– A network-level proxy  
• Most proxies in use are application proxies  
– The proxy understands the way the application works  
• A proxy may only know one application  
– HTTP  
• Many proxies are multipurpose proxies  
– HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.  
<br>


####  Forward proxy  

• An “internal proxy”  
– Commonly used to protect and control user access to the Internet

<br>


####  Reverse proxy  

• Inbound traffic from the Internet to your internal service

<br>


####  Open proxy  

• A third-party, uncontrolled proxy  
– Can be a significant security concern  
– Often used to circumvent existing security controls

<br>


####  Balancing the load  

• Distribute the load  
– Multiple servers  
– Invisible to the end-user  
• Large-scale implementations  
– Web server farms, database farms  
• Fault tolerance  
– Server outages have no effect  
– Very fast convergence  
<br>


####  Active/active load balancing  

• Configurable load - Manage across servers  
• TCP offload - Protocol overhead  
• SSL offload - Encryption/Decryption  
• Caching - Fast response  
• Prioritization - QoS  
• Content switching - Application-centric balancing  
• Some servers are active  
– Others are on standby  
• If an active server fails, the passive server takes its place  
<br>


####  Sensors and collectors  

• Aggregate information from network devices  
– Built-in sensors, separate devices  
– Integrated into switches, routers, servers, firewalls, etc.  
• Sensors  
– Intrusion prevention systems, firewall logs, authentication logs, web server access logs, database transaction logs, email logs  
• Collectors  
– Proprietary consoles (IPS, firewall),  
– SIEM consoles, syslog servers  
– Many SIEMs include a correlation engine to compare diverse sensor data
