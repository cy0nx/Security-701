####  Physical isolation  

• Devices are physically separate  
– Air gap between Switch A and Switch B  
• Must be connected to provide communication  
– Direct connect, or another switch or router  
• Web servers in one rack  
– Database servers on another  
• Customer A on one switch, customer B on another  
– No opportunity for mixing data  
<br>


####  Physical segmentation  

• Separate devices  
– Multiple units, separate infrastructure  
<br>


####  Logical segmentation with VLANs  

• Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)  
– Separated logically instead of physically  
– Cannot communicate between VLANs without a Layer 3 device / router  
<br>


####  SDN (Software Defined Networking)  

• Networking devices have different functional planes of operation  
– Data, control, and management planes  
• Split the functions into separate logical units  
– Extend the functionality and management of a single device  
– Perfectly built for the cloud  
• Infrastructure layer / Data plane  
– Process the network frames and packets  
– Forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT  
• Control layer / Control plane  
– Manages the actions of the data plane  
– Routing tables, session tables, NAT tables  
– Dynamic routing protocol updates  
• Application layer / Management plane  
– Configure and manage the device  
– SSH, browser, API
