####  Capacity planning  

• Match supply to the demand  
– This isn’t always an obvious equation  
• Too much demand  
– Application slowdowns and outages  
• Too much supply  
– You’re paying too much  
• Requires a balanced approach  
– Add the right amount of people  
– Apply appropriate technology  
– Build the best infrastructure  
<br>


####  People  

• Some services require human intervention  
– Call center support lines  
– Technology services  
• Too few employees  
– Recruit new staff  
– It may be time consuming to add more staff  
• Too many employees  
– Redeploy to other parts of the organization  
– Downsize  
<br>


####  Technology  

• Pick a technology that can scale  
– Not all services can easily grow and shrink  
• Web services  
– Distribute the load across multiple web services  
• Database services  
– Cluster multiple SQL servers  
– Split the database to increase capacity  
• Cloud services  
– Services on demand  
– Seemingly unlimited resources (if you pay the money)  
<br>


####  Infrastructure  

• The underlying framework  
– Application servers, network services, etc.  
– CPU, network, storage  
• Physical devices  
– Purchase, configure, and install  
• Cloud-based devices  
– Easier to deploy  
– Useful for unexpected capacity changes
