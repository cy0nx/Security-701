####  Availability  

• System uptime  
– Access data, complete transactions  
– A foundation of IT security  
• A balancing act with security  
– Available, but only to the right people  
• We spend a lot of time and money on availability  
– Monitoring, redundant systems  
• An important metric  
– We are often evaluated on total available time  
<br>


####  Resilience  

• Eventually, something will happen  
– Can you maintain availability?  
– Can you recover? How quickly?  
• Based on many different variables  
– The root cause  
– Replacement hardware installation  
– Software patch availability  
– Redundant systems  
• Commonly referenced as MTTR  
– Mean Time to Repair  
<br>


####  Cost  

• How much money is required?  
– Everything ultimately comes down to cost  
– Initial installation  
– Very different across platforms  
• Ongoing maintenance  
– Annual ongoing cost  
• Replacement or repair costs  
– You might need more than one  
• Tax implications  
– Operating or capital expense  
<br>


####  Responsiveness  

• Request information  
– Get a response  
– How quickly did that happen?  
• Especially important for interactive applications  
– Humans are sensitive to delays  
• Speed is an important metric  
– All parts of the application contribute  
– There’s always a weakest link  
<br>


####  Scalability  

• How quickly and easily can we increase or decrease capacity?  
– This might happen many times a day  
– Elasticity  
• There’s always a resource challenge  
– What’s preventing scalability?  
• Needs to include security monitoring  
– Increases and decreases as the system scales  
<br>


####  Ease of deployment  

• An application has many moving parts  
– Web server, database, caching server, firewall, etc.  
• This might be an involved process  
– Hardware resources, cloud budgets, change control  
• This might be very simple  
– Orchestration / automation  
• Important to consider during the product engineering phase  
– One missed detail can cause deployment issues  
<br>


####  Risk transference  

• Many methods to minimize risk  
– Transfer the risk to a third-party  
• Cybersecurity insurance  
– Attacks and downtime can be covered  
– Popular with the rise in ransomware  
• Recover internal losses  
– Outages and business downtime  
• Protect against legal issues from customers  
– Limit the costs associated with legal proceedings  
<br>


####  Ease of recovery  

• Something will eventually go wrong  
– Time is money  
– How easily can you recover?  
• Malware infection  
– Reload operating system from original media - 1 hour  
– Reload from corporate image - 10 minutes  
• Another important design criteria  
– This may be critical to the final product  
<br>


####  Patch availability  

• Software isn’t usually static  
– Bug fixes, security updates, etc.  
• This is often the first task after installation  
– Make sure you’re running the latest version  
• Most companies have regular updates  
– Microsoft’s monthly patch schedule  
• Some companies rarely patch  
– This might be a significant concern  
<br>


####  Inability to patch  

• What if patching wasn’t an option?  
– This happens more often than you might think  
• Embedded systems  
– HVAC controls  
– Time clocks  
• Not designed for end-user updates  
– This is a bit short sighted  
– Especially these days  
• May need additional security controls  
– A firewall for your time clock  
<br>


####  Power  

• A foundational element 
– This can require extensive engineering  
• Overall power requirements  
– Data center vs. office building  
• Primary power  
– One or more providers  
• Backup services  
– UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)  
– Generators  
<br>


####  Compute  

• An application’s heavy lifting  
– More than just a single CPU  
• The compute engine  
– More options available in the cloud  
• May be limited to a single processor  
– Easier to develop  
• Use multiple CPUs across multiple clouds  
– Additional complexity  
– Enhanced scalability
