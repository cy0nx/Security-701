###  AAA framework  

• Identification  
– This is who you claim to be  
– Usually your username  

• Authentication  
– Password and other authentication factors  

• Authorization  
– Based on your identification and authentication, what access do you have?  

• Accounting  
– Resources used: Login time, data sent and received, logout time  
<br>


####  Authenticating systems  

• You have to manage many devices  
• A system can’t type a password  
• How can you truly authenticate a device?  
– Put a digitally signed certificate on the device  
• Other business processes rely on the certificate  
– Access to the VPN from authorized devices  
– Management software can validate the end device  
<br>


####  Certificate authentication  
• An organization has a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)  
• The organization creates a certificate for a device  
– And digitally signs the certificate with the organization’s CA  
• The certificate can now be included on a device as an authentication factor  
– The CA’s digital signature is used to validate the certificate

####  Authorization models  

• The user or device has now authenticated  
– To what do they now have access?  
• Users and services -> data and applications  
• Put an authorization model in the middle  
– Define by Roles, Organizations, Attributes, etc  
<br>


####  No authorization model  

• A simple relationship  
– User -> Resource  
• Some issues with this method  
– Difficult to understand why an authorization may exist  
– Does not scale  
<br>


####  Using an authorization model  

• Add an abstraction  
– Reduce complexity  
– Create a clear relationship between the user and the resource  
• Administration is streamlined  
– Easy to understand the authorizations  
– Support any number of users or resources
