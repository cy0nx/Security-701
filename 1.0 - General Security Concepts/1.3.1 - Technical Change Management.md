####  Technical change management  

• Put the change management process into action  
– Execute the plan  
• There’s no such thing as a simple upgrade  
– Separate events may be required  
• Change management is often concerned with “what” needs to change  
– The technical team is concerned with “how” to change it  
<br>


####  Allow list / deny list  

• Any application can be dangerous  
– Vulnerabilities, trojan horses, malware  
• Security policy can control app execution  
• Allow list  
– Nothing runs unless it’s approved  
– Very restrictive  
• Deny list  
– Nothing on the “bad list” can be executed  
– Anti-virus, anti-malware  
<br>


####  Restricted activities  

• The scope of a change is important  
• A change approval isn’t permission to make any change  
• The scope may need to be expanded during the change window  
• The change management process determines the next steps  
<br>


####  Downtime  

• Services will eventually be unavailable  
– Usually scheduled during non-production hours
• If possible, prevent any downtime  
– Switch to secondary system, upgrade the primary, then switch back  
• Minimize any downtime events  
– The process should be as automated as possible  
– Switch back to secondary if issues appear  
– Should be part of the backout plan  
• Send emails and calendar updates  
<br>


####  Restarts  

• It’s common to require a restart  
– Reboot the OS, power cycle the switch, bounce the service  
• Services  
– Stop and restart the service or daemon  
• Applications  
– Close the application completely  
– Launch a new application instance  
<br>


####  Legacy applications  

• Some applications were here before you arrived  
– They’ll be here when you leave  
• Often no longer supported by the developer  
• May be quirky  
– Create specific processes and procedures  
• Become the expert  
<br>


####  Dependencies  

• To complete A, you must complete B  
– A service will not start without other active services  
• Modifying one component may require changing or restarting other components  
• Dependencies may occur across systems  
– Upgrade the firewall code first  
– Then upgrade the firewall management software  
<br>


####  Documentation  

• It can be challenging to keep up with changes  
– Documentation can become outdated very quickly  
• Updating diagrams  
– Modifications to network configurations  
• Updating policies/procedures  
<br>


####  Version control  

• Track changes to a file or configuration data over time  
• Many opportunities to manage versions  
– Router configurations  
– Windows OS patches  
– Application registry entries  
• Not always straightforward  
– Some devices and operating systems provide version control features
