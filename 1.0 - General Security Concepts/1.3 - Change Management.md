####  Change management  

• How to make a change  
– Upgrade software, patch an application, change firewall configuration, modify switch ports  
• One of the most common risks in the enterprise  
• Often overlooked or ignored  
• Have clear policies  
– Frequency, duration, installation process, rollback procedures  
• Sometimes extremely difficult to implement  
<br>


####  Change approval process  

• A formal process for managing change  
– Avoid downtime, confusion, and mistakes  
• A typical approval process  
– Complete the request forms  
– Determine the purpose of the change  
– Identify the scope of the change  
– Schedule a date and time of the change  
– Determine affected systems and the impact  
– Analyze the risk associated with the change  
– Get approval from the change control board  
– Get end-user acceptance after the change is complete  
<br>


####  Ownership  

• An individual or entity needs to make a change  
– They own the process  
• The owner manages the process  
– Process updates are provided to the owner  
– Ensures the process is followed and acceptable  
• Address label printers needs to be upgraded  
– IT handles the actual change  
<br>


####  Stakeholders  

• Who is impacted by this change?  
• This may not be as obvious as you might think  
– A single change can include one individual or the entire company  
• Upgrade software used for shipping labels  
<br>


####  Impact analysis  

• Determine a risk value  
– i.e., high, medium, low  
• The risks can be minor or far-reaching  
– The “fix” doesn’t actually fix anything  
– The fix breaks something else  
– Operating system failures  
– Data corruption  
• What’s the risk with NOT making the change?  
– Security vulnerability  
– Application unavailability  
– Unexpected downtime to other services  
<br>


####  Test results  

• Sandbox testing environment  
– No connection to the real world or production system  
– A technological safe space  
• Use before making a change to production  
– Try the upgrade, apply the patch  
– Test and confirm before deployment  
• Confirm the backout plan  
– Move everything back to the original  
– A sandbox can’t consider every possibility  
<br>


####  Backout plan  

• The change will work perfectly and nothing will ever go bad  
• You should always have a way to revert your changes  
• This isn’t as easy as it sounds  
– Some changes are difficult to revert  
– Always have good backups  
<br>


####  Maintenance window  

• When is the change happening?  
– This might be the most difficult part of the process  
• During the workday may not be the best option  
• Overnights are often a better choice  
• The time of year may be a consideration  
– Retail networks are frozen during the holiday season  
<br>


####  Standard operating procedure  

• Change management is critical  
• The process must be well documented  
– Should be available on the Intranet  
• Changes to the process are reflected in the standards
