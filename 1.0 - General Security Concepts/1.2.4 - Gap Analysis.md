###  Gap Analysis  

• Where you are compared with where you want to be  
– The “gap” between the two  
• This may require extensive research  
– Get ready for emails, data gathering, and technical research  
<br>


####  Choosing the framework  

• Work towards a known baseline  
• Determine the end goal  
• ISO/IEC 27001  
– Information security management systems  
<br>


####  Evaluate people and processes  

• Get a baseline of employees  
– Formal experience  
– Current training  
– Knowledge of security policies and procedures  
• Examine the current processes  
– Research existing IT systems  
– Evaluate existing security policies  
<br>


####  Compare and contrast  

• The comparison  
– Evaluate existing systems  
• Identify weaknesses  
• A detailed analysis  
– Examine broad security categories  
– Break those into smaller segments  
<br>


####  The analysis and report  

• The final comparison  
• Need a path to get from the current security to the goal  
• Time to create the gap analysis report  
– A formal description of the current state  
– Recommendations for meeting the baseline
