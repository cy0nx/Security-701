####  Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)  

• Policies, procedures, hardware, software, people  
– Digital certificates: create, distribute, manage, store, revoke  
• This is a big, big, endeavor  
– Lots of planning  
• Also refers to the binding of public keys to people or devices  
– The certificate authority  
– It’s all about trust  
<br>


####  Symmetric encryption  

• A **single**, shared key  
– Encrypt with the key  
– Decrypt with the same key  
– If it gets out, you’ll need another key  
• Secret key algorithm  
– A shared secret  
• Doesn’t scale very well  
– Can be challenging to distribute  
• Very fast to use  
– Less overhead than asymmetric encryption  
– Often combined with asymmetric encryption  
<br>


####  Asymmetric encryption  

• Public key cryptography  
– **Two (or more)** mathematically related keys  
• Private key  
– Keep this private  
• Public key  
– Anyone can see this key  
• The private key is the only key that can decrypt data encrypted with the public key  
– You can’t derive the private key from the public key

####  The key pair  

• Asymmetric encryption  
– Public Key Cryptography  
• Key generation  
– Build both the public and private key at the same time  
– Large prime numbers    
– Lots and lots of math  
• Everyone can have the public key  
– Only Alice has the private key  
<br>


####  Key escrow  

• Someone else holds your decryption keys  
– Your private keys are in the hands of a 3rd-party  
• This can be a legitimate business arrangement  
– A business might need access to employee information  
– Government agencies may need to decrypt partner data  
• Controversial?  
– Of course  
– But may still be required  
<br>


####  It’s all about the process  

• Need clear process and procedures  
– Keys are incredibly important pieces of information  
• You must be able to trust your 3rd-party  
– Access to the keys is at the control of the 3rd-party  
• Carefully controlled conditions
