###  Zero trust  

• Many networks are relatively open on the inside  
– Once you’re through the firewall, there are few security controls  
• Zero trust is a holistic approach to network security  
– Covers every device, every process, every person  
• Everything must be verified  
– Nothing is inherently trusted  
– Multi-factor authentication, encryption, system permissions, additional firewalls, monitoring and analytics, etc  
<br>


####  Planes of operation  

• Split the network into functional planes  
– Applies to both physical, virtual, and cloud components  
• Data plane  
– Process the frames, packets, and network data  
– Processing, forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT  
• Control plane  
– Manages the actions of the data plane  
– Define policies and rules  
– Determines how packets should be forwarded  
– Routing tables, session tables, NAT tables  
<br>


####  Controlling trust  

• Adaptive identity  
– Consider the source and the requested resources  
– Multiple risk indicators - relationship to the organization, physical location, type of connection, IP

####  Policy enforcement point  

• Subjects and systems  
– End users, applications, non-human entities  
• Policy enforcement point (PEP)  
– The gatekeeper  
• Allow, monitor, and terminate connections  
– Can consist of multiple components working together  
<br>


####  Applying trust in the planes  

• Policy Decision Point  
– There’s a process for making an authentication decision  
• Policy Engine  
– Evaluates each access decision based on policy and other information sources  
– Grant, deny, or revoke  
• Policy Administrator  
– Communicates with the Policy Enforcement Point  
– Generates access tokens or credentials  
– Tells the PEP to allow or disallow access address, etc.  
– Make the authentication stronger, if needed  
• Threat scope reduction  
– Decrease the number of possible entry points  
• Policy-driven access control  
– Combine the adaptive identity with a predefined set of rules  
<br>


####  Security zones  

• Security is more than a one-to-one relationship  
– Broad categorizations provide a security-related foundation  
• Where are you coming from and where are you going  
– Trusted, untrusted  
– Internal network, external network  
– VPN 1, VPN 5, VPN 11  
– Marketing, IT, Accounting, Human Resources  
• Using the zones may be enough by itself to deny access  
– For example, Untrusted to Trusted zone traffic  
• Some zones are implicitly trusted  
– For example, Trusted to Internal zone traffic
