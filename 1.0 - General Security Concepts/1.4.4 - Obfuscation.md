####  Obfuscation  

• The process of making something unclear  
– It’s now much more difficult to understand  
• But it’s not impossible to understand  
– If you know how to read it  
• Hide information in plain sight  
– Store payment information without storing a credit card number  
• Hide information inside of an image  
– Steganography

####  Steganography  

• Greek for “concealed writing”  
– Security through obscurity  
• Message is invisible - But it’s really there  
• The covertext - The container document or file  
<br>


####  Common steganography techniques  

• Network based - Embed messages in TCP packets  
• Use an image - Embed the message in the image itself  
• Invisible watermarks - Yellow dots on printers  
<br>


####  Other steganography types  

• Audio steganography  
– Modify the digital audio file  
– Interlace a secret message within the audio  
• Video steganography  
– A sequence of images  
– Use image steganography on a larger scale  
– Manage the signal to noise ratio  
– Potentially transfer much more information  
<br>


####  Tokenization  

• Replace sensitive data with a non-sensitive placeholder  
– SSN 266-12-1112 is now 691-61-8539  
• Common with credit card processing  
– Use a temporary token during payment  
– An attacker capturing the card numbers can’t use them later  
• This isn’t encryption or hashing  
– The original data and token aren’t mathematically related  
– No encryption overhead

####  Data masking  

• Data obfuscation  
– Hide some of the original data  
• Protects PII  
– And other sensitive data  
• May only be hidden from view  
– The data may still be intact in storage  
– Control the view based on permissions  
• Many different techniques  
– Substituting, shuffling, encrypting, masking out, etc.
