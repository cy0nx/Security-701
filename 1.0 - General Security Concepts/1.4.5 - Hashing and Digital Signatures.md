####  Hashes  

• Represent data as a short string of text  
– A message digest, a fingerprint  
• One-way trip  
– Impossible to recover the original message from the digest  
– Used to store passwords / confidentiality  
• Verify a downloaded document is the same as the original  
– Integrity  
• Can be a digital signature  
– Authentication, non-repudiation, and integrity  
<br>


####  Collision  

• Hash functions  
– Take an input of any size  
– Create a fixed size string  
– Message digest, checksum  
• The hash should be unique  
– Different inputs should never create the same hash  
– If they do, it’s a collision  
• MD5 has a collision problem  
– Found in 1996 - Don’t use MD5 for anything important  
<br>


####  Practical hashing  

• Verify a downloaded file  
– Hashes may be provided on the download site  
– Compare the downloaded file hash with the posted hash value  
• Password storage  
– Instead of storing the password, store a salted hash  
– Compare hashes during the authentication process  
– Nobody ever knows your actual password  
<br>


####  Adding some salt  

• Salt  
– Random data added to a password when hashing  
• Every user gets their own random salt  
– The salt is commonly stored with the password  
• Rainbow tables won’t work with salted hashes  
– Additional random value added to the original password  
• This slows things down the brute force process  
– It doesn’t completely stop the reverse engineering   
<br>


####  Salting the hash  

• Each user gets a different random hash  
– The same password creates a different hash

####  Digital signatures  

• Prove the message was not changed  
– Integrity  
• Prove the source of the message  
– Authentication  
• Make sure the signature isn’t fake  
• Sign with the private key  
– The message doesn’t need to be encrypted  
– Nobody else can sign this  
• Verify with the public key  
– Any change in the message will invalidate the signature
