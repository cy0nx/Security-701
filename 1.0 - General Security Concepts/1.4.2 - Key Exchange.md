####  Key exchange  

• A logistical challenge  
– How do you share an encryption key across an insecure medium without physically transferring the key?  
• Out-of-band key exchange  
– Don’t send the symmetric key over the ‘net  
– Telephone, courier, in-person, etc.  
• In-band key exchange  
– It’s on the network  
– Protect the key with additional encryption  
– Use asymmetric encryption to deliver a symmetric key

####  Real-time encryption/decryption  

• There’s a need for fast security  
– Without compromising the security part  
• Share a symmetric session key using asymmetric encryption  
– Client encrypts a random (symmetric) key with a server’s public key  
– The server decrypts this shared key and uses it to encrypt data  
– This is the session key  
• Implement session keys carefully  
– Need to be changed often (ephemeral keys)  
– Need to be unpredictable

####  Symmetric key from asymmetric keys  

• Use public and private key cryptography to create a symmetric key
