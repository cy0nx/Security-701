####  Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)  

• Many different security tools on the market  
– NGFWs, IPS, vulnerability scanners, etc.  
– They all have their own way of evaluating a threat  
• Managed by National Institute of  
– Standards and Technology (NIST) http://scap.nist.gov  
• Allows tools to identify and act on the same criteria  
– Validate the security configuration  
– Confirm patch installs  
– Scan for a security breach  
<br>


####  Using SCAP  

• SCAP content can be shared between tools  
– Focused on configuration compliance  
– Easily detect applications with known vulnerabilities  
• Especially useful in large environments  
– Many different operating systems and applications  
• This specification standard enables automation  
– Even between different tools  
• Automation types  
– Ongoing monitoring  
– Notification and alerting  
– Remediation of noncompliant systems  
<br>


####  Benchmarks  

• Apply security best-practices to everything  
– Operating systems, cloud providers, mobile devices, etc.  
– The bare minimum for security settings  
• Example: Mobile device  
– Disable screenshots, disable screen recordings, prevent voice calls when locked, force encryption backups, disable additional VPN profiles, configure a “lost phone” message, etc.  
• Popular benchmarks - Center for Internet Security (CIS)  
– https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/  
<br>


####  Agents/agentless  

• Check to see if the device is in compliance  
– Install a software agent onto the device  
– Run an on-demand agentless check  
• Agents can usually provide more detail  
– Always monitoring for real-time notifications  
– Must be maintained and updated  
• Agentless runs without a formal install  
– Performs the check, then disappears  
– Does not require ongoing updates to an agent  
– Will not inform or alert if not running  
<br>


####  SIEM  

• Security Information and Event Management  
– Logging of security events and information  
• Log collection of security alerts  
– Real-time information  
• Log aggregation and long-term storage  
– Usually includes advanced reporting features  
• Data correlation  
– Link diverse data types  
• Forensic analysis  
– Gather details after an event  
<br>


####  Anti-virus and anti-malware  

• Anti-virus is the popular term  
– Refers specifically to a type of malware  
– Trojans, worms, macro viruses  
• Malware refers to the broad malicious software category  
– Anti-malware stops spyware, ransomware, fileless malware  
• The terms are effectively the same these days  
– The names are more of a marketing tool  
– Anti-virus software is also anti-malware software now  
– Make sure your system is using a comprehensive solution  
<br>


####  Data Loss Prevention (DLP)  

• Where’s your data?  
– Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, medical records  
• Stop the data before the attacker gets it  
– Data “leakage”  
• So many sources, so many destinations  
– Often requires multiple solutions  
– Endpoint clients  
– Cloud-based systems  
– Email, cloud storage, collaboration tools  
<br>


####  SNMP  

• Simple Network Management Protocol  
– A database of data (MIB) - Management Information Base  
– The database contains OIDs - Object Identifiers  
– Poll devices over udp/161  
• Request statistics from a device  
– Server, firewall, workstation, switch, router, etc.  
• Poll devices at fixed intervals  
– Create historical performance graphs  
<br>


####  SNMP traps  

• Most SNMP operations expect a poll  
– Devices then respond to the SNMP request  
– This requires constant polling  
• SNMP traps can be configured on the monitored device  
– Communicates over udp/162  
• Set a threshold for alerts  
– If the number of CRC errors increases by 5, send a trap  
– Monitoring station can react immediately  
<br>


####  NetFlow  

• Gather traffic statistics from all traffic flows  
– Shared communication between devices  
• NetFlow  
– Standard collection method  
– Many products and options  
• Probe and collector  
– Probe watches network communication  
– Summary records are sent to the collector  
• Usually a separate reporting app  
– Closely tied to the collector  
<br>


####  Vulnerability scanners  

• Usually minimally invasive  
– Unlike a penetration test  
• Port scan  
– Poke around and see what’s open  
• Identify systems  
– And security devices  
• Test from the outside and inside  
– Don’t dismiss insider threats  
• Gather as much information as possible  
– We’ll separate wheat from chaff later
