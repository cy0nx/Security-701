####  Root cause analysis  

• Determine the ultimate cause of an incident  
– Find the root cause by asking “why”  
• Create a set of conclusions regarding the incident  
– Backed up by the facts  
• Don’t get tunnel vision  
– There can be more than a single root cause  
• Mistakes happen  
– The response to the mistake is the difference

####  Threat hunting  

• The constant game of cat and mouse  
– Find the attacker before they find you  
• Strategies are constantly changing  
– Firewalls get stronger, so phishing gets better  
• Intelligence data is reactive  
– You can’t see the attack until it happens  
• Speed up the reaction time  
– Use technology to fight
