####  Secure baselines  

• The security of an application environment should be well defined  
– All application instances must follow this baseline  
– Firewall settings, patch levels, OS file versions  
– May require constant updates  
• Integrity measurements check for the secure baseline  
– These should be performed often  
– Check against well-documented baselines  
– Failure requires an immediate correction  
<br>


####  Establish baselines  

• Create a series of baselines  
– Foundational security policies  
• Security baselines are often available from the manufacturer  
– Application developer  
– Operating system manufacturer  
– Appliance manufacturer  
• Many operating systems have extensive options  
– There are over 3,000 group policy settings in Windows 10  
– Only some of those are associated with security  
<br>


####  Deploy baselines  

• We now have established detailed security baselines  
– How do we put those baselines into action?  
• Deploy the baselines  
– Usually managed through a centrally administered console  
• May require multiple deployment mechanisms  
– Active Directory group policy, MDM, etc.  
• Automation is the key  
– Deploy to hundreds or thousands of devices  
<br>


####  Maintain baselines  

• Many of these are best practices  
– They rarely change  
• Other baselines may require ongoing updates  
– A new vulnerability is discovered  
– An updated application has been deployed  
– A new operating system is installed  
• Test and measure to avoid conflicts  
– Some baselines may contradict others  
– Enterprise environments are complex
