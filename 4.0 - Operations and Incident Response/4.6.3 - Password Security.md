####  Password complexity and length  

• Make your password strong  
– Resist guessing or brute-force attack  
• Increase password entropy  
– No single words, no obvious passwords  
– Mix upper and lower case, letters, and special characters  
• Stronger passwords are commonly at least 8 characters  
– These requirements change as processing speed gets faster  
– Consider a phrase or set of words

####  Password age and expiration  

• Password age  
– How long since a password was modified  
• Password expiration  
– Password works for a certain amount of time  
– 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, etc.  
– After the expiration date, the password does not work  
– System remembers password history, requires unique passwords  
• Critical systems might change more frequently  
– Every 15 days or every week

####  Password managers  

• Important to use different passwords for each account  
– Remembering all of them would be impractical  
• Store all of your passwords in a single database  
– Encrypted, protected  
– Can include multifactor tokens  
• Built-in to many operating systems  
– And some browsers  
• Enterprise password managers  
– Centralized management and recovery options

####  Passwordless authentication  

• Many breaches are due to poor password control  
– Weak passwords, insecure implementation  
• Authenticate without a password  
– This solves many password management issues  
• You may already be passwordless  
– Facial recognition, security key, etc.  
• Passwordless may not be the primary authentication method  
– Used with a password or additional factors

####  Just-in-time permissions  

• In many organizations, the IT team is assigned administrator/root elevated account rights  
– This would be a great account to attack  
• Grant admin access for a limited time  
– No permanent administrator rights  
– The principle of least privilege  
• A breached user account never has elevated rights  
– Narrow the scope of a breach  
• Request access from a central clearinghouse  
– Grants or denies based on predefined security policies  
• Password vaulting  
– Primary credentials are stored in a password vault  
– The vault controls who gets access to credentials  
• Accounts are temporary  
– Just-in-time process creates a time-limited account  
– Administrator receives ephemeral credentials  
– Primary passwords are never released  
– Credentials are used for one session then deleted
