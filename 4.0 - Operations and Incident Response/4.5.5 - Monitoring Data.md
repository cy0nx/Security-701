####  FIM (File Integrity Monitoring)  

• Some files change all the time  
– Some files should NEVER change  
• Monitor important operating system and application files  
– Identify when changes occur  
• Windows - SFC (System File Checker)  
• Linux - Tripwire  
• Many host-based IPS options

####  Data Loss Prevention (DLP)  

• Where’s your data?  
– Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, medical records  
• Stop the data before the attackers get it  
– Data “leakage”  
• So many sources, so many destinations  
– Often requires multiple solutions in different places  
<br>


####  Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems  

• On your computer  
– Data in use  
– Endpoint DLP  
• On your network  
– Data in motion  
• On your server  
– Data at rest  
<br>


####  USB blocking  

• DLP on a workstation  
– Allow or deny certain tasks  
• November 2008 - U.S. Department of Defense  
– Worm virus “agent.btz” replicates using USB storage  
– Bans removable flash media and storage devices  
• All devices had to be updated  
– Local DLP agent handled USB blocking  
• Ban was lifted in February 2010  
– Replaced with strict guidelines  
<br>


####  Cloud-based DLP  

• Located between users and the Internet  
– Watch every byte of network traffic  
– No hardware, no software  
• Block custom defined data strings  
– Unique data for your organization  
• Manage access to URLs  
– Prevent file transfers to cloud storage  
• Block viruses and malware  
– Anything traversing the network  
<br>


####  DLP and email  

• Email continues to be the most critical risk vector  
– Inbound threats, outbound data loss  
• Check every email inbound and outbound  
– Internal system or cloud-based  
• Inbound  
– Block keywords, identify impostors, quarantine email messages  
• Outbound  
– Fake wire transfers, W-2 transmissions, employee information
