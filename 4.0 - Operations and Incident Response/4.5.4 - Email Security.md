####  Email security challenges  

• The protocols used to transfer emails include relatively few security checks  
– It’s very easy to spoof an email  
• Spoofing happens all the time  
– Check your spam folder  
• The email looks as if it originated from james@professormesser.com  
– But did it? How can you tell?  
• A reputable sender will configure email validation  
– Publicly available on the sender’s DNS server  
<br>


####  Mail gateway  

• The gatekeeper  
– Evaluates the source of inbound email messages  
– Blocks it at the gateway before it reaches the user  
– On-site or cloud-based  
<br>


####  Sender Policy Framework (SPF)  

• SPF protocol  
– Sender configures a list of all servers authorized to send emails for a domain  
• List of authorized mail servers are added to a DNS TXT record  
– Receiving mail servers perform a check to see if incoming mail really did come from an authorized host  
<br>


####  Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)  

• A mail server digitally signs all outgoing mail  
– The public key is in the DKIM TXT record  
• The signature is validated by the receiving mail servers  
– Not usually seen by the end user  
<br>


####  DMARC  

• Domain-based Message Authentication,  
– Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)  
– An extension of SPF and DKIM  
• The domain owner decides what receiving email servers should do with emails not validating using SPF and DKIM  
– That policy is written into a DNS TXT record  
– Accept all, send to spam, or reject the email  
• Compliance reports are sent to the email administrator  
– The domain owner can see how emails are received
