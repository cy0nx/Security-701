####  Securing a wireless network  

• An organization’s wireless network can contain confidential information  
– Not everyone is allowed access  
• Authenticate the users before granting access  
– Who gets access to the wireless network?  
– Username, password, multi-factor authentication  
• Ensure that all communication is confidential  
– Encrypt the wireless data  
• Verify the integrity of all communication  
– The received data should be identical to the original sent data  
– A message integrity check (MIC)  
<br>


####  The WPA2 PSK problem  

• WPA2 has a PSK brute-force problem  
– Listen to the four-way handshake  
– Some methods can derive the PSK hash without the handshake  
– Capture the hash  
• With the hash, attackers can brute force the pre-shared key (PSK)  
• This has become easier as technology improves  
– A weak PSK is easier to brute force  
– GPU processing speeds  
– Cloud-based password cracking  
• Once you have the PSK, you have everyone’s wireless key  
– There’s no forward secrecy  
<br>


####  WPA3 and GCMP  

• Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3)  
– Introduced in 2018  
• GCMP block cipher mode  
– Galois/Counter Mode Protocol  
– A stronger encryption than WPA2  
• GCMP security services  
– Data confidentiality with AES  
– Message Integrity Check (MIC) with  
– Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC)  
<br>


####  SAE  

• WPA3 changes the PSK authentication process  
– Includes mutual authentication  
– Creates a shared session key without sending that key across the network  
– No more four-way handshakes, no hashes, no brute force attacks  
• Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)  
– A Diffie-Hellman derived key exchange with an authentication component  
– Everyone uses a different session key, even with the same PSK  
– An IEEE standard - the dragonfly handshake  
<br>


####  Wireless authentication methods  

• Gain access to a wireless network  
– Mobile users, temporary users  
• Credentials  
– Shared password / pre-shared key (PSK)  
– Centralized authentication (802.1X)  
• Configuration  
– Part of the wireless network connection  
– Prompted during the connection process  
<br>


####  Wireless security modes  

• Configure the authentication on your wireless access point / wireless router  
• Open System  
– No authentication password is required  
• WPA3-Personal / WPA3-PSK  
– WPA2 or WPA3 with a pre-shared key  
– Everyone uses the same 256-bit key  
• WPA3-Enterprise / WPA3-802.1X  
– Authenticates users individually with an authentication server (i.e., RADIUS)  
<br>


####  AAA framework  

• Identification  
– This is who you claim to be - Usually your username  
• Authentication  
– Prove you are who you say you are  
– Password and other authentication factors  
• Authorization  
– Based on your identification and authentication, what access do you have?  
• Accounting  
– Resources used: Login time, data sent and received, logout time  
<br>


####  RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service)  

• One of the more common AAA protocols  
– Supported on a wide variety of platforms and devices  
– Not just for dial-in  
• Centralize authentication for users  
– Routers, switches, firewalls  
– Server authentication  
– Remote VPN access  
– 802.1X network access  
• RADIUS services available on almost any server operating system  
<br>


####  IEEE 802.1X  

• Port-based Network Access Control (NAC)  
– You don’t get access to the network until you authenticate  
• Used in conjunction with an access database  
– RADIUS, LDAP, TACACS+  
<br>


####  EAP  

• Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)  
– An authentication framework  
• Many different ways to authenticate based on RFC standards  
– Manufacturers can build their own EAP methods  
• EAP integrates with 802.1X  
– Prevents access to the network until the authentication succeeds  
<br>


####  IEEE 802.1X and EAP  

• Supplicant - the client  
• Authenticator - The device that provides access  
• Authentication server - Validates the client credentials
