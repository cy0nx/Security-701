####  Network-based firewalls  

• Filter traffic by port number or application  
– Traditional vs. NGFW  
• Encrypt traffic  
– VPN between sites  
• Most firewalls can be layer 3 devices (routers)  
– Often sits on the ingress/egress of the network  
– Network Address Translation (NAT)  
– Dynamic routing  
<br>


####  Next-generation Firewalls (NGFW)  

• The OSI Application Layer  
– Layer 7 firewall  
• Can be called different names  
– Application layer gateway  
– Stateful multilayer inspection  
– Deep packet inspection  
• Requires some advanced decodes  
– Every packet must be analyzed, categorized, and a security decision determined  
<br>


####  Ports and protocols  

• Make forwarding decisions based on protocol (TCP or UDP) and port number  
– Traditional port-based firewalls  
– Add to an NGFW for additional security policy options  
• Based on destination protocol and port  
– Web server: tcp/80, tcp/443  
– SSH server: tcp/22  
– Microsoft RDP: tcp/3389  
– DNS query: udp/53  
– NTP: udp/123  
<br>


####  Firewall rules  

• A logical path  
– Usually top-to-bottom  
• Can be very general or very specific  
– Specific rules are usually at the top  
• Implicit deny  
– Most firewalls include a deny at the bottom  
– Even if you didn’t put one  
• Access control lists (ACLs)  
– Allow or disallow traffic  
– Groupings of categories  
– Source IP, Destination IP, port number, time of day, application, etc.  
<br>


####  Screened subnet  

• An additional layer of security between the you and the Internet  
– Public access to public resources  
– Private data remains inaccessible  
<br>


####  IPS rules  

• Intrusion Prevention System  
– Usually integrated into an NGFW  
• Different ways to find malicious traffic  
– Look at traffic as it passes by  
• Signature-based - Look for a perfect match  
• Anomaly-based  
– Build a baseline of what’s “normal”  
– Unusual traffic patterns are flagged  
• You determine what happens when unwanted traffic appears  
– Block, allow, send an alert, etc.  
• Thousands of rules - Or more  
• Rules can be customized by group  
– Or as individual rules  
• This can take time to find the right balance  
– Security / alert “noise” / false positives
