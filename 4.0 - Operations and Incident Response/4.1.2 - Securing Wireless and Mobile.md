– Sample the existing wireless spectrum  
• Identify existing access points  
– You may not control all of them  
• Work around existing frequencies  
– Layout and plan for interference  
• Plan for ongoing site surveys  
– Things will certainly change  
• Heat maps  
– Identify wireless signal strengths
