####  Vulnerability scanning  

• Usually minimally invasive  
– Unlike a penetration test  
• Port scan  
– Poke around and see what’s open  
• Identify systems  
– And security devices  
• Test from the outside and inside  
– Don’t dismiss insider threats  
• Gather as much information as possible  
– We’ll separate wheat from chaff later

####  Static code analyzers  

• Static Application Security Testing (SAST)  
– Help to identify security flaws  
• Many security vulnerabilities found easily  
– Buffer overflows, database injections, etc.  
• Not everything can be identified through analysis  
– Authentication security, insecure cryptography, etc.  
– Don’t rely on automation for everything  
• Still have to verify each finding  
– False positives are an issue  
<br>


####  Dynamic analysis (fuzzing)  

• Send random input to an application  
– Fault-injecting, robustness testing, syntax testing, negative testing  
• Looking for something out of the ordinary  
– Application crash, server error, exception  
• 1988 class project at the University of Wisconsin  
– “Operating System Utility Program Reliability”  
– Professor Barton Miller  
– The Fuzz Generator  
<br>


####  Fuzzing engines and frameworks  

• Many different fuzzing options  
– Platform specific, language specific, etc.  
• Very time and processor resource heavy  
– Many, many different iterations to try  
– Many fuzzing engines use high-probability tests  
• Carnegie Mellon Computer  
– Emergency Response Team (CERT)  
– CERT Basic Fuzzing Framework (BFF)

####  Package monitoring  

• Some applications are distributed in a package  
– Especially open source  
– Supply chain integrity  
• Confirm the package is legitimate  
– Trusted source  
– No added malware  
– No embedded vulnerabilities  
• Confirm a safe package before deployment  
– Verify the contents
