####  Identity and Access Management (IAM)  

• Applications are available anywhere  
– Desktop, browser, mobile device, etc.  
• Data can be located anywhere  
– Cloud storage, private data centers, etc.  
• Many different application users  
– Employees, vendors, contractors, customers  
• Give the right permissions to the right people at the right time  
– Prevent unauthorized access  
• Identify lifecycle management  
– Every entity (human and non-human) gets a digital identity  
• Access control  
– An entity only gets access to what they need  
• Authentication and authorization  
– Entities must prove they are who they claim to be  
• Identity governance  
– Track an entity’s resource access  
– May be a regulatory requirement  
• Provisioning/de-provisioning user accounts  
• The user account creation process  
– And the account removal process  
• Provisioning and de-provisioning occurs for certain events  
– Hiring, transfers, promotions, job separation  
• Account details  
– Name, attributes, group permissions, other permissions  
• An important part of the IAM process  
– An initial checkpoint to limit access  
– Nobody gets Administrator access  
<br>


####  Permission assignments  

• Each entity gets limited permissions  
– Just enough to do their job  
– Group assignments are common  
• Storage and files can be private to that user  
– Even if another person is using the same computer  
• No privileged access to the operating system  
– Specifically not allowed on a user account  
<br>


####  Identity proofing  

• I could be anyone  
– The IAM process should confirm who I am  
• Resolution  
– Who the system thinks you are  
• Validation  
– Gathering information from the user (password, security questions, etc.)  
• Verification / Attestation  
– Passport, in-person meeting, etc.  
– Automated verification is also an option  
<br>


####  Single sign-on (SSO)  

• Provide credentials one time  
– Get access to all available or assigned resources  
– No additional authentication required  
• Usually limited by time  
– A single authentication can work for 24 hours  
– Authenticate again after the timer expires  
• The underlying authentication infrastructure must support SSO  
– Not always an option  
<br>


####  LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)  

• Protocol for reading and writing directories over an IP network  
– An organized set of records, like a phone directory  
• X.500 specification was written by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)  
– They know directories!  
• DAP ran on the OSI protocol stack  
– LDAP is lightweight  
• LDAP is the protocol used to query and update an X.500 directory  
– Used in Windows Active Directory, Apple OpenDirectory, Novell eDirectory, etc.  
<br>


####  X.500 Directory Information Tree  

• Hierarchical structure  
– Builds a tree  
• Container objects  
– Country, organization, organizational units  
• Leaf objects  
– Users, computers, printers, files  
<br>


####  Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)  

• Open standard for authentication and authorization  
– You can authenticate through a third-party to gain access  
– One standard does it all, sort of  
• Not originally designed for mobile apps  
– This has been SAML’s largest roadblock  
<br>


####  OAuth  

• Authorization framework  
– Determines what resources a user will be able to access  
• Created by Twitter, Google, and many others  
– Significant industry support  
• Not an authentication protocol  
– OpenID Connect handles the single sign-on authentication  
– OAuth provides authorization between applications  
• Relatively popular  
– Used by Twitter, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more  
<br>


####  Federation  

• Provide network access to others  
– Not just employees - Partners, suppliers, customers, etc.  
– Provides SSO and more  
• Third-parties can establish a federated network  
– Authenticate and authorize between the two organizations  
– Login with your Facebook credentials  
• The third-parties must establish a trust relationship  
– And the degree of the trust  
<br>


####  Interoperability  

• Many different ways to communicate with an authentication server  
– More than a simple login process  
• Often determined by what is at hand  
– VPN concentrator can talk to a LDAP server  
– We have an LDAP server  
• A new app uses OAuth  
– Need to allow authentication API access  
• The interoperability is dependent on the environment  
– This is often part of a much larger IAM strategy
