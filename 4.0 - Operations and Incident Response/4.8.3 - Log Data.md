####  Security log files  

• Detailed security-related information  
– Blocked and allowed traffic flows  
– Exploit attempts  
– Blocked URL categories  
– DNS sinkhole traffic  
• Critical security information  
– Documentation of every traffic flow  
– Summary of attack info  
– Correlate with other logs  
<br>


####  Firewall logs  

• Traffic flows through the firewall  
– Source/destination IP, port numbers, disposition  
• Next Generation Firewalls (NGFW)  
– Logs the application used,  
– URL filtering categories, anomalies and suspicious data  
<br>


####  Application logs  

• Specific to the application  
– Information varies widely  
• Windows  
– Event Viewer / Application Log  
• Linux / macOS/  
– var/log  
• Parse the log details on the SIEM  
– Filter out unneeded info  
<br>


####  Endpoint logs  

• Attackers often gain access to endpoints  
– Phones, laptops, tablets, desktops, servers, etc.  
• There’s a lot of data on the endpoint  
– Logon events, policy changes, system events, processes, account management, directory services, etc.  
• Everything rolls up to the SIEM  
– Security Information and Event Manager  
• Use with correlation of security events  
– Combine IPS events with endpoint status  
<br>


####  OS-specific security logs  

• OS security events  
– Monitoring apps  
– Brute force, file changes  
– Authentication details  
• Find problems before they happen  
– Brute force attacks  
– Disabled services  
• May require filtering  
– Don’t forward everything  
<br>


####  IPS/IDS logs  

• Intrusion prevention system/Intrusion detection system  
– Usually integrated into an NGFW  
• Logs contain information about predefined vulnerabilities  
– Known OS vulnerabilities, generic security events  
• Common data points  
– Timestamp  
– Type or class of attack  
– Source and destination IP  
– Source and destination port  
<br>


####  Network logs  

• Switches, routers, access points, VPN concentrators  
– And other infrastructure devices  
• Network changes  
– Routing updates  
– Authentication issues  
– Network security issues  
<br>


####  Metadata  

• Metadata  
– Data that describes other data sources  
• Email  
– Header details, sending servers, destination address  
• Mobile  
– Type of phone, GPS location  
• Web  
– Operating system, browser type, IP address  
• Files  
– Name, address, phone number, title  
<br>


####  Vulnerability scans  

• Lack of security controls  
– No firewall  
– No anti-virus  
– No anti-spyware  
• Misconfigurations  
– Open shares  
– Guest access  
• Real vulnerabilities  
– Especially newer ones  
– Occasionally the old ones  
<br>


####  Automated reports  

• Most SIEMs include a report generator  
– Automate common security reports  
• May be easy or complex to create  
– The SIEM may have its own report generator  
– Third-party report generators may be able to  
<br>


####  access the database  

• Requires human intervention  
– Someone has to read the reports  
• These can be involved to create  
– Huge data storage and extensive processing time  
<br>


####  Dashboards  

• Real-time status information  
– Get summaries on a single screen  
• Add or remove information  
– Most SIEMs and reporting systems allow for customization  
• Shows the most important data  
– Not designed for long-term analysis  
<br>


####  Packet captures  

• Solve complex application issues  
– Get into the details  
• Gathers packets on the network  
– Or in the air  
– Sometimes built into the device  
• View detailed traffic information  
– Identify unknown traffic  
– Verify packet filtering and security controls  
– View a plain-language description of the application data
