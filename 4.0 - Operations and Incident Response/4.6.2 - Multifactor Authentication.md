####  Multifactor authentication  

• Prove who you are  
– Use different methods  
– A memorized password  
– A mobile app  
– Your GPS location  
• Factors  
– Something you know  
– Something you have  
– Something you are  
– Somewhere you are  
• There are other factors as well  
<br>


####  Something you know  

• Password  
– Secret word/phrase, string of characters  
– Very common authentication factor  
• PIN  
– Personal identification number  
– Not typically contained anywhere on a smart card or ATM card  
• Pattern  
– Complete a series of patterns  
– Only you know the right format  
<br>


####  Something you have  

• Smart card  
– Integrates with devices  
– May require a PIN  
• USB security key - Certificate is on the USB device  
• Hardware or software tokens  
– Generates pseudo-random authentication codes  
• Your phone  
– SMS a code to your phone  
<br>


####  Something you are  

• Biometric authentication  
– Fingerprint, iris scan, voice print  
• Usually stores a mathematical representation of your biometric  
– Your actual fingerprint isn’t usually saved  
• Difficult to change  
– You can change your password  
– You can’t change your fingerprint  
• Used in very specific situations  
– Not foolproof  
<br>


####  Somewhere you are  

• Provide a factor based on your location  
– The transaction only completes if you are in a particular geography  
• IP address  
– Not perfect, but can help provide more info  
– Works with IPv4, not so much with IPv6  
• Mobile device location services  
– Geolocation to a very specific area  
– Must be in a location that can receive GPS information or near an identified mobile or 802.11 network  
– Still not a perfect identifier of location
