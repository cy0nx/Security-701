####  Unencrypted network data  

• Network traffic is important data  
– Everything must be protected  
• Some protocols aren’t encrypted  
– All traffic sent in the clear  
– Telnet, FTP, SMTP, IMAP  
• Verify with a packet capture  
– View everything sent over the network  
<br>


####  Protocol selection  

• Use a secure application protocol  
– Built-in encryption  
• A secure protocol may not be available  
– This may be a deal-breaker  
<br>


####  Port selection  

• Secure and insecure application connections may be available  
– It’s common to run secure and insecure on different ports  
• HTTP and HTTPS  
– In-the-clear and encrypted web browsing  
– HTTP: Port 80  
– HTTPS: Port 443  
• The port number does not guarantee security  
– Confirm the security features are enabled  
– Packet captures may be necessary

####  Transport method  

• Don’t rely on the application  
– Encrypt everything over the current network transport  
• 802.11 Wireless  
– Open access point: No transport-level encryption  
– WPA3: All user data is encrypted  
• Virtual Private Network (VPN)  
– Create an encrypted tunnel  
– All traffic is encrypted and protected  
– Often requires third-party services and software
