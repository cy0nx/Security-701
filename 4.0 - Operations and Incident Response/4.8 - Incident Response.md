####  Security incidents  

• User clicks an email attachment and executes malware  
– Malware then communicates with external servers  
• DDoS  
– Botnet attack  
• Confidential information is stolen  
– Thief wants money or it goes public  
• User installs peer-to-peer software and allows external access to internal servers  
<br>


####  Preparing for an incident  

• Communication methods  
– Phones and contact information  
• Incident handling hardware and software  
– Laptops, removable media, forensic software, digital cameras, etc.  
• Incident analysis resources  
– Documentation, network diagrams, baselines, critical file hash values  
• Incident mitigation software  
– Clean OS and application images  
• Policies needed for incident handling  
– Everyone knows what to do  
<br>


####  The challenge of detection  

• Many different detection sources  
– Different levels of detail, different levels of perception  
• A large amount of “volume”  
– Attacks are incoming all the time  
– How do you identify the legitimate threats?  
• Incidents are almost always complex  
– Extensive knowledge needed  
– Analysis  
• An incident might occur in the future  
– This is your heads-up  
• Web server log  
– Vulnerability scanner in use  
• Exploit announcement  
– Monthly Microsoft patch release,  
– Adobe Flash update  
• Direct threats - A hacking group doesn’t like you  
<br>


####  Analysis  

• An attack is underway - Or an exploit is successful  
• Buffer overflow attempt  
– Identified by an intrusion detection/prevention system  
• Anti-virus software identifies malware  
– Deletes from OS and notifies administrator  
• Host-based monitor detects a configuration change  
– Constantly monitors system files  
• Network traffic flows deviate from the norm  
– Requires constant monitoring  
<br>


####  Isolation and containment  

• Generally a bad idea to let things run their course  
– An incident can spread quickly  
– It’s your fault at that point  
• Sandboxes  
– An isolated operating system  
– Run malware and analyze the results  
– Clean out the sandbox when done  
• Isolation can be sometimes be problematic  
– Malware or infections can monitor connectivity  
– When connectivity is lost, everything could be deleted/encrypted/damaged  
<br>


####  Recovery after an incident  

• Get things back to normal  
– Remove the bad, keep the good  
• Eradicate the bug  
– Remove malware  
– Disable breached user accounts  
– Fix vulnerabilities  
• Recover the system  
– Restore from backups  
– Rebuild from scratch  
– Replace compromised files  
– Tighten down the perimeter  
<br>


####  Lessons learned  

• Learn and improve  
– No system is perfect  
• Post-incident meeting  
– Invite everyone affected by the incident  
• Don’t wait too long  
– Memories fade over time  
– Some recommendations can be applied to the next event  
<br>


####  Answer the tough questions  

• What happened, exactly?  
– Timestamp of the events  
• How did your incident plans work?  
– Did the process operate successfully?  
• What would you do differently next time?  
– Retrospective views provide context  
• Which indicators would you watch next time?  
– Different precursors may give you better alerts  
<br>


####  Training for an incident  

• There’s limited on-the-job training when a security event occurs  
– Be ready when an incident is identified  
• Train the team prior to an incident  
– Initial response  
– Investigation plans  
– Incident reporting  
– And more  
• This can be an expensive endeavor  
– Especially with larger response teams
