####  Qualitative risk assessment  

• Identify significant risk factors  
– Ask opinions about the significance  
– Display visually with traffic light grid or similar method  
– Quantitative risk assessment  
• ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence)  
– How likely is it that a hurricane will hit? In Montana? In Florida?  
• Asset value (AV)  
– The value of the asset to the organization  
– Includes the cost of the asset, the effect on company sales, potential regulatory fines, etc.  
• Exposure factor (EF)  
– The percentage of the value lost due to an incident  
– Losing a quarter of the value is .25  
– Losing the entire asset is 1.0  
• SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)  
– What is the monetary loss if a single event occurs?  
– Asset value (AV) x Exposure factor (EF)  
– Laptop stolen = $1,000 (AV) x 1.0 (EF) = $1,000 (SLE)  
• ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy)  
– ARO x SLE  
– Seven laptops stolen a year (ARO) x $1,000 (SLE) = $7,000  
• The business impact can be more than monetary  
– Quantitative vs. qualitative

####  Impact  

• Life  
– The most important consideration  
• Property  
– The risk to buildings and assets  
• Safety  
– Some environments are too dangerous to work  
• Finance  
– The resulting financial cost  
• Reputation  
– An event can cause status or character problems   
<br>


####  Likelihood and probability  

• Risk likelihood  
– A qualitative measurement of risk  
– Rare, possible, almost certain, etc.  
• Risk probability  
– A quantitative measurement of risk  
– A statistical measurement  
– Can be based on historical performance  
• Often considered similar in scope  
– Can be used interchangeably in casual conversation  
<br>


####  Risk appetite and tolerance  

• Risk appetite  
– A broad description of risk-taking deemed acceptable  
– The amount of accepted risk before taking any action to reduce that risk  
• Risk appetite posture  
– Qualitative description for readiness to take risk  
– Conservative, neutral, and expansionary  
• Risk tolerance  
– An acceptable variance (usually larger) from the risk appetite  
• Risk appetite  
– A highway’s speed limit  
– Government authorities have set the speed limit  
– The limit is an acceptable balance between safety and convenience  
• Risk tolerance  
– Drivers will be ticketed when the speed limit is violated  
– Ticketing usually occurs well above the posted limit  
– This tolerance can change with road conditions, weather, traffic, etc.

####  Risk register  

• Every project has a plan, but also has risk  
– Identify and document the risk associated with each step  
– Apply possible solutions to the identified risks  
– Monitor the results  
• Key risk indicators  
– Identify risks that could impact the organization  
• Risk owners  
– Each indicator is assigned someone to manage the risk  
• Risk threshold  
– The cost of mitigation is at least equal to the value gained by mitigation
