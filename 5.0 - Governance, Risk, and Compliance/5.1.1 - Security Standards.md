####  Security standards  

• A formal definition for using security technologies and processes  
– Complete documentation reduces security risk  
– Everyone understands the expectations  
• These may be written in-house  
– Your requirements may be unique  
• Many standards are already available  
– ISO (International Organization for Standardization)  
– NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)  
<br>


####  Password  

• What makes a good password?  
– Every organization has their own requirements  
– Create a formal password complexity policy  
• Define acceptable authentication methods  
– No local accounts, only LDAP to the AD database, etc.  
• Create policies for secure password resets  
– Avoid unauthorized resets and access  
• Other password policies  
– Password change frequency, secure password storage requirements, password manager options, etc.  
<br>


####  Access control  

• How does an organization control access to data?  
– Determine which information, at what time  
– And under which circumstances  
• Define which access control types can be used  
– No discretionary, mandatory only, etc.  
• Determine how a user gets access  
– Require privilege documentation  
• Document how access may be removed  
– Security issue, expiration, contract renewals, etc.  
<br>


####  Physical security  

• Rules and policies regarding physical security controls  
– Doors, building access, property security  
• Granting physical access  
– Different for employees vs. visitors  
• Define specific physical security systems  
– Electronic door locks, ongoing monitoring, motion detection, etc.  
• Additional security concerns  
– Mandatory escorts, off-boarding, etc.  
<br>


####  Encryption  

• Define specific standards for encrypting and securing data  
– All things cryptographic  
– Can include implementation standards  
• Password storage  
– Methods and techniques  
• Data encryption minimums  
– Algorithms for data in use, data in transit, data at rest  
– Will probably be different for each state
