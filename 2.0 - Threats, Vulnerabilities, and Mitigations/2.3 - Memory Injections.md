####  Finding malware  

• Malware runs in memory  
– Memory forensics can find the malicious code  
• Memory contains running processes  
– DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries)   
– Threads  
– Buffers  
– Memory management functions  
– And much more  
• Malware is hidden somewhere  
– Malware runs in its own process  
– Malware injects itself into a legitimate process  
<br>


####  Memory injection  

• Add code into the memory of an existing process  
– Hide malware inside of the process  
• Get access to the data in that process  
– And the same rights and permissions  
– Perform a privilege escalation  
<br>


####  DLL injection  

• Dynamic-Link Library  
– A Windows library containing code and data  
– Many applications can use this library  
• Attackers inject a path to a malicious DLL  
– Runs as part of the target process  
• One of the most popular memory injection methods  
– Relatively easy to implement
