####  Operating systems  

• A foundational computing platform  
– This makes the OS a very big target  
• Remarkably complex  
– Millions of lines of code  
– More code means more opportunities for a security issue  
• The vulnerabilities are already in there  
– We’ve just not found them yet  
<br>


####  A month of OS updates  

• A normal month of Windows updates  
– Patch Tuesday - 2nd Tuesday of each month  
– Other companies have similar schedules  
<br>


####  Best practices for OS vulnerabilities  

• Always update  
– Monthly or on-demand updates  
– It’s a race between you and the attackers  
• May require testing before deployment  
– A patch might break something else  
• May require a reboot  
– Save all data  
• Have a fallback plan
