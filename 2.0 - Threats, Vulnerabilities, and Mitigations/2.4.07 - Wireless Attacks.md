####  It started as a normal day  

• Surfing along on your wireless network  
– And then you’re not  
• And then it happens again - And again  
• You may not be able to stop it  
– There’s (almost) nothing you can do  
– Time to get a long patch cable  
• Wireless deauthentication  
– A significant wireless denial of service (DoS) attack  
<br>


####  802.11 management frames  

• 802.11 wireless includes a number of management features  
– Frames that make everything work  
• Important for the operation of 802.11 wireless  
– How to find access points, manage QoS, associate/disassociate with an access point, etc.  
• Original wireless standards did not add protection for management frames  
– Sent in the clear  
– No authentication or validation  
<br>


####  Protecting against deauth attacks  

• IEEE has already addressed the problem  
– 802.11w - July 2014  
• Some of the important management frames are encrypted  
– Disassociate, deauthenticate, channel switch announcements, etc.  
• Not everything is encrypted  
– Beacons, probes, authentication, association  
• 802.11w is required for 802.11ac compliance  
– This will roll out going forward

####  Radio frequency (RF) jamming  

• Denial of Service  
– Prevent wireless communication  
• Transmit interfering wireless signals  
– Decrease the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiving device  
– The receiving device can’t hear the good signal  
– Interference, not jamming  
– Microwave oven, fluorescent lights  
• Jamming is intentional  
– Someone wants your network to not work  
<br>


####  Wireless jamming  

• Many different types  
– Constant, random bits / Constant, legitimate frames  
– Data sent at random times - random data and legitimate frames  
– Reactive jamming - only when someone else tries to communicate  
• Needs to be somewhere close  
– Difficult to be effective from a distance  
• Time to go fox hunting  
– You’ll need the right equipment to hunt down the jam  
– Directional antenna, attenuator
