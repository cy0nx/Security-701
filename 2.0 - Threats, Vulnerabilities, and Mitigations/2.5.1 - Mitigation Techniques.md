####  Patching  

• Incredibly important  
– System stability, security fixes  
• Monthly updates  
– Incremental (and important)  
• Third-party updates  
– Application developers, device drivers  
• Auto-update  
– Not always the best option  
• Emergency out-of-band updates  
– Zero-day and important security discoveries  
<br>


####  Encryption  

• Prevent access to application data files  
– File system encryption  
• Full disk encryption (FDE)  
– Encrypt everything on the drive  
– BitLocker, FileVault, etc.  
• File level encryption  
– Windows EFS  
• Application data encryption  
– Managed by the app  
– Stored data is protected  
<br>


####  Monitoring   

• Aggregate information from devices  
– Built-in sensors, separate devices  
– Integrated into servers, switches, routers, firewalls, etc.  
• Sensors  
– Intrusion prevention systems, firewall logs, authentication logs, web server access logs, database transaction logs, email logs  
• Collectors  
– Proprietary consoles (IPS, firewall),  
– SIEM consoles, syslog servers  
– Many SIEMs include a correlation engine to compare diverse sensor data

####  Least privilege  

• Rights and permissions should be set to the bare minimum  
– You only get exactly what’s needed to complete your objective  
• All user accounts must be limited  
– Applications should run with minimal privileges  
• Don’t allow users to run with administrative privileges  
– Limits the scope of malicious behavior  
<br>


####  Configuration enforcement  

• Perform a posture assessment  
– Each time a device connects  
• Extensive check  
– OS patch version  
– EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) version  
– Status of firewall and EDR  
– Certificate status  
• Systems out of compliance are quarantined  
– Private VLAN with limited access  
– Recheck after making corrections  
<br>


####  Decommissioning  

• Should be a formal policy  
– Don’t throw your data into the trash  
– Someone will find this later  
• Mostly associated with storage devices  
– Hard drive  
– SSD  
– USB drives  
• Many options for physical devices  
– Recycle the device for use in another system  
– Destroy the device
