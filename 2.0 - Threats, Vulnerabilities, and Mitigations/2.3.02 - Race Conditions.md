####  Race condition  

• A programming conundrum  
– Sometimes, things happen at the same time  
– This can be bad if you’ve not planned for it  
• Time-of-check to time-of-use attack (TOCTOU)  
– Check the system  
– When do you use the results of your last check?  
– Something might happen between the check and the use

####  Race condition example  

• Two bank accounts with $100  
– User 1 and User 2 transfer $50 from Account A to Account B  
– Expected outcome:  
Account A has $50, Account B has $150 (or A has $0 and B has $200)  
• What if you don’t perform proper validation?  
– User 1 and User 2 check the account balances ($100 in each account)  
– User 1 transfers $50 from Account A (now at $50) to Account B (now at $150)  
– At about the same time, user 2 transfers $50 from Account A  
(still has $100, right?, so now at $50) to Account B (now at $200)  
– Outcome: Account A has $50, Account B has $200
