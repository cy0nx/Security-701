####  Buffer overflows  

• Overwriting a buffer of memory  
– Spills over into other memory areas  
• Developers need to perform bounds checking  
– The attackers spend a lot of time looking for openings  
• Not a simple exploit  
– Takes time to avoid crashing things  
– Takes time to make it do what you want  
• A really useful buffer overflow is repeatable  
– Which means that a system can be compromised
