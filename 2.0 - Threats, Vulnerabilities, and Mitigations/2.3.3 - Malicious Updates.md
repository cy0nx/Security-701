####  Software updates  

• Always keep your operating system and applications updated  
– Updates often include bug fixes and security patches  
• This process has its own security concerns  
– Not every update is equally secure  
• Follow best practices  
– Always have a known-good backup  
– Install from trusted sources

####  Downloading and updating  

• Install updates from a downloaded file  
– Always consider your actions  
– Every installation could potentially be malicious  
• Confirm the source  
– A random pop-up during web browsing may not be legitimate  
• Visit the developer’s site directly  
– Don’t trust a random update button or random downloaded file  
• Many operating systems will only allow signed apps  
– Don’t disable your security controls

####  Automatic updates  

• The app updates itself  
– Often includes security checks / digital signatures  
• Relatively trustworthy  
– Comes directly from the developer
