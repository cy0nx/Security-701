####  Virtualization security  

• Quite different than non-virtual machines  
• Quantity of resources vary between VMs  
– CPU, memory, storage  
• Many similarities to physical machines  
– Complexity adds opportunity for the attackers  
• Virtualization vulnerabilities  
– Local privilege escalations  
– Command injection  
– Information disclosure

####  VM escape protection  

• The virtual machine is self-contained  
– There’s no way out  
– Or is there?  
• Virtual machine escape  
– Break out of the VM and interact with the host operating system or hardware  
• Once you escape the VM, you have great control  
– Control the host and control other guest VMs  
• This would be a huge exploit  
– Full control of the virtual world

####  Resource reuse  

• The hypervisor manages the relationship between physical and virtual resources  
– Available RAM, storage space, CPU availability, etc.  
• These resources can be reused between VMs  
– Hypervisor host with 4 GB of RAM  
– Supports three VMs with 2 GB of RAM each  
– RAM is allocated and shared between VMs  
• Data can inadvertently be shared between VMs  
– Time to update the memory management features  
– Security patches can mitigate the risk
