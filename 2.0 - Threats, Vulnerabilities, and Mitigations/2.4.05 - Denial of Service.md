####  Denial of service  

• Force a service to fail  
– Overload the service  
• Take advantage of a design failure or vulnerability  
– Keep your systems patched!  
• Cause a system to be unavailable  
– Competitive advantage  
• Create a smokescreen for some other exploit  
– Precursor to a DNS spoofing attack

####  A “friendly” DoS  

• Unintentional DoSing  
– It’s not always a ne’er-do-well  
• Network DoS - Layer 2 loop without STP  
• Bandwidth DoS  
– Downloading multi-gigabyte  
– Linux distributions over a DSL line  
• The water line breaks  
– Get a good shop vacuum  
<br>


####  Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)  

• Launch an army of computers to bring down a service  
– Use all the bandwidth or resources - traffic spike  
• This is why the attackers have botnets  
– Thousands or millions of computers at your command  
– At its peak, Zeus botnet infected over 3.6 million PCs  
– Coordinated attack  
• Asymmetric threat  
– The attacker may have fewer resources than the victim  
<br>


####  DDoS reflection and amplification  

• Turn your small attack into a big attack  
– Often reflected off another device or service  
• An increasingly common network DDoS technique  
– Turn Internet services against the victim  
• Uses protocols with little (if any) authentication or checks  
– NTP, DNS, ICMP A common example of protocol abuse
