####  Supply chain risk  

• The chain contains many moving parts  
– Raw materials, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, customers, consumers  
• Attackers can infect any step along the way  
– Infect different parts of the chain without suspicion  
– People trust their suppliers  
• One exploit can infect the entire chain

####  Service providers  

• You can control your own security posture  
– You can’t always control a service provider  
• Service providers often have access to internal services  
– An opportunity for the attacker  
• Many different types of providers  
– Network, utility, office cleaning, payroll/accounting, cloud services, system administration, etc.  
• Consider ongoing security audits of all providers  
– Should be included with the contract

####  Hardware providers  

• Can you trust your new server/router/switch/firewall/ software?  
– Supply chain cyber security  
• Use a small supplier base  
– Tighter control of vendors  
• Strict controls over policies and procedures  
– Ensure proper security is in place  
• Security should be part of the overall design  
– There’s a limit to trust

####  Software providers  

• Trust is a foundation of security  
– Every software installation questions our trust  
• Initial installation  
– Digital signature should be confirmed during installation  
• Updates and patches  
– Some software updates are automatic  
• Open source is not immune  
– Compromising the source code itself
