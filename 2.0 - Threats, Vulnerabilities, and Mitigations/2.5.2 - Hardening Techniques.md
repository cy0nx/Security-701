####  System hardening  

• Many and varied  
– Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, et al.  
• Updates  
– Operating system updates/service packs, security patches  
• User accounts  
– Minimum password lengths and complexity  
– Account limitations  
• Network access and security  
– Limit network access  
• Monitor and secure  
– Anti-virus, anti-malware  
<br>


####  Encryption  

• Prevent access to application data files  
– File system encryption  
– Windows Encrypting File System (EFS)  
• Full disk encryption (FDE)  
– Encrypt everything on the drive  
– Windows BitLocker, Apple FileVault, etc.  
• Encrypt all network communication  
– Virtual Private Networking (VPN)  
– Application encryption  
<br>


####  The endpoint  

• The user’s access - Applications and data  
• Stop the attackers - Inbound attacks, outbound attacks  
• Many different platforms - Mobile, desktop  
• Protection is multi-faceted - Defense in depth  
<br>


####  Endpoint detection and response (EDR)  

• A different method of threat protection  
– Scale to meet the increasing number of threats  
• Detect a threat  
– Signatures aren’t the only detection tool  
– Behavioral analysis, machine learning, process monitoring  
– Lightweight agent on the endpoint  
• Investigate the threat - Root cause analysis  
• Respond to the threat  
– Isolate the system, quarantine the threat, rollback to a previous config  
– API driven, no user or technician intervention required  
<br>


####  Host-based firewall  

• Software-based firewall  
– Personal firewall, runs on every endpoint  
• Allow or disallow incoming or outgoing application traffic  
– Control by application process  
– View all data  
• Identify and block unknown processes  
– Stop malware before it can start  
• Manage centrally  
<br>


####  Finding intrusions  

• Host-based Intrusion  
– Prevention System (HIPS) Recognize and block known attacks  
– Secure OS and application configs, validate incoming service requests  
– Often built into endpoint protection software  
• HIPS identification  
– Signatures, heuristics, behavioral  
– Buffer overflows, registry updates, writing files to the Windows folder  
– Access to non-encrypted data  
<br>


####  Open ports and services  

• Every open port is a possible entry point  
– Close everything except required ports  
• Control access with a firewall  
– NGFW would be ideal  
• Unused or unknown services  
– Installed with the OS or from other applications  
• Applications with broad port ranges  
– Open port 0 through 65,535  
• Use Nmap or similar port scanner to verify  
– Ongoing monitoring is important  
<br>


####  Default password changes  

• Every network device has a management interface  
– Critical systems, other devices  
• Many applications also have management or maintenance interfaces  
– These can contain sensitive data  
• Change default settings  
– Passwords  
• Add additional security  
– Require additional logon  
– Add 3rd-party authentication  
<br>


####  Removal of unnecessary software  

• All software contains bugs  
– Some of those bugs are security vulnerabilities  
• Every application seems to have a completely different patching process  
– Can be challenging to manage ongoing updates  
• Remove all unused software  
– Reduce your risk  
– An easy fix
