####  Brand impersonation  

• Pretend to be a well-known brand  
– Coca-cola, McDonald’s, Apple, etc.  
• Create tens of thousands of impersonated sites  
– Get into the Google index, click an ad, get a WhatsApp message  
• Visitors are presented with a pop-up  
• Malware infection is almost guaranteed  
– Display ads, site tracking, data exfiltration
