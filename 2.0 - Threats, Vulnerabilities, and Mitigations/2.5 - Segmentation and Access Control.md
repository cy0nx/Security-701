####  Segmenting the network  

• Physical, logical, or virtual segmentation  
– Devices, VLANs, virtual networks  
• Performance  
– High-bandwidth applications  
• Security  
– Users should not talk directly to database servers  
– The only applications in the core are SQL and SSH  
• Compliance  
– Mandated segmentation (PCI compliance)  
– Makes change control much easier

####  Access control lists (ACLs)  

• Allow or disallow traffic  
– Groupings of categories  
– Source IP, Destination IP, port number, time of day, application, etc.  
• Restrict access to network devices  
– Limit by IP address or other identifier  
– Prevent regular user / non-admin access  
• Be careful when configuring these  
– You can accidentally lock yourself out  
<br>


####  Access control lists  

• List the permissions  
– Bob can read files  
– Fred can access the network  
– James can access network 192.168.1.0/24 using tcp ports 80, 443, and 8088  
• Many operating systems use ACLs to provide access to files  
– A trustee and the access rights allowed  
– Application allow list / deny list  
<br>


####  Examples of allow and deny lists  

• Decisions are made in the operating system  
– Often built-in to the operating system management  
• Application hash  
– Only allows applications with this unique identifier  
• Certificate  
– Allow digitally signed apps from certain publishers  
• Path  
– Only run applications in these folders  
• Network zone  
– The apps can only run from this network zone
