####  Replay attack  

• Useful information is transmitted over the network  
– A crafty hacker will take advantage of this  
• Need access to the raw network data  
– Network tap, ARP poisoning,  
– Malware on the victim computer  
• The gathered information may help the attacker  
– Replay the data to appear as someone else  
• This is not an on-path attack  
– The actual replay doesn’t require the original workstation

####  Header manipulation  

• Information gathering  
– Wireshark, Kismet  
• Exploits  
– Cross-site scripting  
• Modify headers  
– Tamper, Firesheep, Scapy  
• Modify cookies  
– Cookies Manager+ (Firefox add-on)  
<br>


####  Prevent session hijacking  

• Encrypt end-to-end  
– They can’t capture your session ID if they can’t see it  
– Additional load on the web server (HTTPS)  
– Firefox extension: HTTPS Everywhere, Force-TLS  
– Many sites are now HTTPS-only  
• Encrypt end-to-somewhere  
– At least avoid capture over a local wireless network  
– Still in-the-clear for part of the journey  
– Personal VPN
