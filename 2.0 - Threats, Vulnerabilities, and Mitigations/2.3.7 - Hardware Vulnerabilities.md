####  Hardware vulnerabilities  

• We are surrounded by hardware devices  
– Many do not have an accessible operating system  
• These devices are potential security issues  
– A perfect entry point for an attack  
• Everything is connecting to the network  
– Light bulbs, garage doors, refrigerators, door locks  
– IoT is everywhere  
• The security landscape has grown  
– Time to change your approach  
<br>


####  Firmware  

• The software inside of the hardware  
– The operating system of the hardware device  
• Vendors are the only ones who can fix their hardware  
– Assuming they know about the problem  
– And care about fixing it  
<br>


####  End-of-life  

• **End of life (EOL)**  
– Manufacturer stops selling a product  
– May continue supporting the product  
– Important for security patches and updates  
• **End of service life (EOSL)**  
– Manufacturer stops selling a product  
– Support is no longer available for the product  
– No ongoing security patches or updates  
• Technology EOSL is a significant concern  
– Security patches are part of normal operation  
<br>


####  Legacy platforms  

• Some devices remain installed for a long time  
• Legacy devices  
– Older operating systems, applications, middleware  
• May be running end-of-life software  
– The risk needs to be compared to the return  
• May require additional security protections  
– Additional firewall rules  
– IPS signatures for older operating systems
