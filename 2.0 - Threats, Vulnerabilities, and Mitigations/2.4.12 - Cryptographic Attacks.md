####  Cryptographic attacks  

• You’ve encrypted data and sent it to another person  
– Is it really secure?  
– How do you know?  
• The attacker doesn’t have the combination (the key)  
– So they break the safe (the cryptography)  
• Finding ways to undo the security  
– There are many potential cryptographic shortcomings  
– The problem is often the implementation

####  Birthday attack  

• In a classroom of 23 students, what is the chance of two students sharing a birthday?  
– About 50%  
– For a class of 30, the chance is about 70%  
• In the digital world, this is a hash collision  
– A hash collision is the same hash value for two different plaintexts  
– Find a collision through brute force  
• The attacker will generate multiple versions of plaintext to match the hashes  
– Protect yourself with a large hash output size  
<br>


####  Collisions  

• Hash digests are supposed to be unique  
– Different input data should not create the same hash  
• MD5 hash  
– Message Digest Algorithm 5  
– First published in April 1992  
– Collisions identified in 1996  
• December 2008: Researchers created CA certificate that appeared legitimate when MD5 is checked  
– Built other certificates that appeared to be legit and issued by RapidSSL  
<br>


####  Downgrade attack  

• Instead of using perfectly good encryption, use something that’s not so great  
– Force the systems to downgrade their security  
• 2014 - TLS vulnerability POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption)  
– On-path attack  
– Forces clients to fallback to SSL 3.0  
– SSL 3.0 has significant cryptographic vulnerabilities  
– Because of POODLE, modern browsers won’t fall back to SSL 3.0
