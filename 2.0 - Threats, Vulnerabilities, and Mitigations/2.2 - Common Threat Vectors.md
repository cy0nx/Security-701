####  Threat vectors  

• A method used by the attacker  
– Gain access or infect to the target  
– Also called “attack vectors”  
• A lot of work goes into finding vulnerabilities in these vectors  
• IT security professional spend their career watching these vectors  
– Protect existing vectors  
– Find new vectors  
<br>


####  Message-based vectors  

• Phishing attacks  
– Links in an email, links send via text or IM  
• Deliver the malware to the user  
– Attach it to the email  
– Scan all attachments, never launch untrusted links  
• Social engineering attacks  
– Invoice scams, cryptocurrency scams  
<br>


####  Image-based vectors  

• Easy to identify a text-based threat  
– It’s more difficult to identify the threat in an image  
• Some image formats can be a threat  
– The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) format  
– Image is described in XML (Extensible Markup Language)  
• Significant security concerns  
– HTML injection  
– Javascript attack code  
• Browsers must provide input validation  
<br>


####  File-based vectors  

• More than just executables  
– Malicious code can hide in many places  
• Adobe PDF  
– A file format containing other objects  
• ZIP/RAR files (or any compression type)  
– Contains many different files  
• Microsoft Office  
– Documents with macros  
<br>


####  Voice call vectors  

• Vishing  
– Phishing over the phone  
• Spam over IP  
– Large-scale phone calls  
• War dialing  
• Call tampering  
– Disrupting voice calls  
<br>


####  Removable device vectors  

• Get around the firewall  
– The USB interface  
• Malicious software on USB flash drives  
– Infect air gapped networks  
– Industrial systems, high-security services  
• USB devices can act as keyboards  
– Hacker on a chip  
• Data exfiltration  
– Terabytes of data walk out the door  
– Zero bandwidth used  
<br>


####  Vulnerable software vectors  

• Client-based  
– Infected executable  
– Known (or unknown) vulnerabilities  
– May require constant updates  
• Agentless  
– No installed executable  
– Compromised software on the server would affect all users  
– Client runs a new instance each time  
<br>


####  Unsupported systems vectors  

• Patching is an important prevention tool  
• Unsupported systems aren’t patched  
• Outdated operating systems  
• A single system could be an entry  
– Keep your inventory and records current  
<br>


####  Unsecure network vectors  

• The network connects everything  
– Ease of access for the attackers  
• Wireless  
– Outdated security protocols (WEP, WPA, WPA2)  
• Wired  
– Unsecure interfaces - No 802.1X  
• Bluetooth  
– Reconnaissance, implementation vulnerabilities  
<br>


####  Open service ports  

• Most network-based services connect over a TCP or UDP port  
• Every open port is an opportunity for the attacker  
– Application vulnerability or misconfiguration  
• Every application has their own open port  
– More services expand the attack surface  
• Firewall rules  
– Must allow traffic to an open port  
<br>


####  Default credentials  

• Most devices have default usernames and passwords  
• The right credentials provide full control  
• Very easy to find the defaults for your access point or router  
<br>


####  Supply chain vectors  

• Tamper with the underlying infrastructure  
• Managed service providers (MSPs)  
– Access many different customer networks from one location  
• Gain access to a network using a vendor  
• Suppliers  
– Counterfeit networking equipment  
– Install backdoors, substandard performance and availability
