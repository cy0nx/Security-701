####  Physical attacks  

• Old-school security  
– No keyboard, no mouse, no command line  
• Many different ways to circumvent digital security  
– A physical approach must be considered  
• If you have physical access to a server, you have full control  
– An operating system can’t stop an in-person attack  
• Door locks keep out the honest people

####  Brute force  

• The physical version - No password required  
• Push through the obstruction - Brawn beats brains  
• Check your physical security  
– Check the windows, try the doors  
• Attackers will try everything  
– You should be prepared for anything

####  RFID cloning  

• RFID is everywhere - Access badges, key fobs  
• Duplicators are on Amazon - Less than $50  
• The duplication process takes seconds  
– Read one card, copy to another  
• This is why we have MFA  
– Use another factor with the card

####  Environmental attacks  

• Attack everything supporting the technology  
– The operating environment  
• Power monitoring  
– An obvious attack  
• HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) and humidity controls  
– Large data centers must be properly cooled  
• Fire suppression
