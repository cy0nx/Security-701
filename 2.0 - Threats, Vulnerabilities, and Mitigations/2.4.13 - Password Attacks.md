####  Plaintext / unencrypted passwords  

• Some applications store passwords “in the clear”  
– No encryption. You can read the stored password.  
– This is rare, thankfully  
• Do not store passwords as plaintext  
– Anyone with access to the password file or database has every credential  
• What to do if your application saves passwords as plaintext:  
– Get a better application  
<br>


####  Hashing a password  

• Hashes represent data as a fixed-length string of text  
– A message digest, or “fingerprint”  
• Will not have a collision (hopefully)  
– Different inputs will not have the same hash  
• One-way trip  
– Impossible to recover the original message from the digest  
– A common way to store passwords  
<br>


####  A hash example  

• SHA-256 hash  
– Used in many applications  
<br>


####  The password file  

• Different across operating systems and applications  
– Different hash algorithms  
<br>


####  Spraying attack  

• Try to login with an incorrect password  
– Eventually you’re locked out  
• There are some common passwords  
• Attack an account with the top three (or more) passwords  
– If they don’t work, move to the next account  
– No lockouts, no alarms, no alerts  
<br>


####  Brute force  

• Try every possible password combination until the hash is matched  
• This might take some time  
– A strong hashing algorithm slows things down  
<br>


####  Brute force  

• Brute force attacks - Online  
– Keep trying the login process  
– Very slow  
– Most accounts will lockout after a number of failed attempts  
• Brute force the hash - Offline  
– Obtain the list of users and hashes  
– Calculate a password hash, compare it to a stored hash  
– Large computational resource requirement
