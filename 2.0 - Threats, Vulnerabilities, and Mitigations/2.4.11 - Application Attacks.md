####  Injection attacks  

• Code injection  
– Adding your own information into a data stream  
• Enabled because of bad programming  
– The application should properly handle input and output  
• So many different injectable data types  
– HTML, SQL, XML, LDAP, etc.  
<br>


####  Privilege escalation  

• Gain higher-level access to a system  
– Exploit a vulnerability  
– Might be a bug or design flaw  
• Higher-level access means more capabilities  
– This commonly is the highest-level access  
– This is obviously a concern  
• These are high-priority vulnerability patches  
– You want to get these holes closed very quickly  
– Any user can be an administrator  
• Horizontal privilege escalation  
– User A can access user B resources  
<br>


####  Mitigating privilege escalation  

• Patch quickly - Fix the vulnerability  
• Updated anti-virus/anti-malware software  
– Block known vulnerabilities  
• Data Execution Prevention  
– Only data in executable areas can run  
• Address space layout randomization  
– Prevent a buffer overrun at a known memory address  
– Elevation of privilege vulnerability  
<br>


####  Cross-site requests  

• Cross-site requests are common and legitimate  
– You visit ProfessorMesser.com  
– Your browser loads text from ProfessorMesser.com  
– Your browser loads a video from YouTube  
– Your browser loads pictures from Instagram  
• HTML on ProfessorMesser.com directs requests from your browser  
– This is normal and expected  
– Most of these are unauthenticated requests  
<br>


####  The client and the server  

• Website pages consist of client-side code and server-side code  
– Many moving parts  
• Client side  
– Renders the page on the screen (HTML, JavaScript)  
• Server side  
– Performs requests from the client (HTML, PHP)  
– Transfer money from one account to another  
– Post a video on YouTube  
<br>


####  Cross-site request forgery  

• One-click attack, session riding  
– XSRF, CSRF (sea surf)  
• Takes advantage of the trust that a web application has for the user  
– The web site trusts your browser  
– Requests are made without your consent or your knowledge  
– Attacker posts a Facebook status on your account  
• Significant web application development oversight  
– The application should have anti-forgery techniques added  
– Usually a cryptographic token to prevent a forgery

####  Directory traversal  

• Directory traversal / path traversal  
– Read files from a web server that are outside of the website’s file directory  
– Users shouldn’t be able to browse the Windows folder  
• Web server software vulnerability  
– Won’t stop users from browsing past the web server root  
• Web application code vulnerability  
– Take advantage of badly written code
