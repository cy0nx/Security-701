####  Vulnerabilities  

• Many applications have vulnerabilities  
– We’ve just not found them yet  
• Someone is working hard to find the next big vulnerability  
– The good guys share these with developers  
• Attackers keep these yet-to-be-discovered holes to the mselves  
– They want to use these vulnerabilities for personal gain  
<br>


####  Zero-day attacks  

• Attackers search for unknown vulnerabilities  
– They create exploits against these vulnerabilities  
• The vendor has no idea the vulnerability exists  
– They don’t have a fix for an unknown problem  
• Zero-day attacks  
– An attack without a patch or method of mitigation  
– A race to exploit the vulnerability or create a patch  
– Difficult to defend against the unknown
