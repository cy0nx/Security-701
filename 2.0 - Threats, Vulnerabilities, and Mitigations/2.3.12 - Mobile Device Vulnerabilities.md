####  Mobile device security  

• Challenging to secure  
– Often need additional security policies and systems  
• Relatively small  
– Can be almost invisible  
• Almost always in motion  
– You never know where it might be  
• Packed with sensitive data  
– Personal and organizational  
• Constantly connected to the Internet  
– Nothing bad happens on the Internet

####  Jailbreaking/rooting  

• Mobile devices are purpose-built systems  
– You don’t have access to the operating system  
• Gaining access  
– Android - Rooting  
– Apple iOS - Jailbreaking  
• Install custom firmware  
– Replaces the existing operating system  
• Uncontrolled access  
– Circumvent security features  
– The MDM becomes relatively useless

####  Sideloading  

• Malicious apps can be a significant security concern  
– One Trojan horse can create a data breach  
• Manage installation sources  
– The global or local app store  
• Jailbreaking circumvents security  
– Sideloading  
– Apps can be installed manually without using an app store  
– An MDM becomes relatively useless
