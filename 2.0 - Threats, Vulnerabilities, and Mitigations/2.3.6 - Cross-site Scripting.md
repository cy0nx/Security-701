####  Cross-site scripting  

• XSS
• Originally called cross-site because of browser security flaws  
– Information from one site could be shared with another  
• One of the most common web app vulnerabilities  
– Takes advantage of the trust a user has for a site  
– Complex and varied  
• XSS commonly uses JavaScript

####  Non-persistent (reflected) XSS attack  

• Web site allows scripts to run in user input  
– Search box is a common source  
• Attacker emails a link that takes advantage of this vulnerability  
– Runs a script that sends credentials/session IDs/cookies to the attacker  
• Script embedded in URL executes in the victim’s browser  
– As if it came from the server  
• Attacker uses credentials/session IDs/cookies to steal victim’s information without their knowledge  
<br>


####  Persistent (stored) XSS attack  

• Attacker posts a message to a social network  
– Includes the malicious payload  
• It’s now “persistent”  
– Everyone gets the payload  
• No specific target  
– All viewers to the page  
• For social networking, this can spread quickly  
– Everyone who views the message can have it posted to their page

####  Protecting against XSS  

• Be careful when clicking untrusted links  
• Consider disabling JavaScript  
• Keep your browser and applications updated  
– Avoid the nasty browser vulnerabilities  
• Validate input  
– Don’t allow users to add their own scripts to an input field
